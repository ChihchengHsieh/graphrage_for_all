# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": 99.0}


Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.

COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": 99.0}


Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": 99.0}


Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": 99.0}


Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

## Report
EXAMINATION:  CHEST AP AND LAT
INDICATION:  History: F with dizziness fall femoral neck fracture
TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
COMPARISON:   chest radiograph
FINDINGS: 
Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation and kyphotic positioning. Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged.  A large hiatal hernia isagain noted.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The mediastinal and hilarcontours are grossly unchanged.  There are low lung volumes with crowding ofbronchovascular structures and pulmonary vascular congestion but no overtpulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identifiedthough assessment of the lung apices is limited due to the patient's chin andneck projecting over these areas.  Linear atelectasis is noted in the leftlung base.  There is no focal consolidation.  The osseous structures arediffusely demineralized.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
