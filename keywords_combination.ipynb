      "\n",
      "1.  **Pulmonary Edema:**\n",
      "    *   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing up pink, frothy mucus, fatigue, and weakness.\n",
      "    *   Causes: cardiogenic pulmonary edema (acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure, volume overload, impaired left ventricular function, pericardial tamponade, and heart valve dysfunction), non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and high altitude pulmonary edema).\n",
      "    *   Relevant clinical signs: acute onset of dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, peripheral edema, jugular venous distension, rales or crackles on auscultation, and signs of right heart failure.\n",
      "    *   Relevant laboratory data: elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), arterial blood gas analysis, chest radiography, laboratory tests, and echocardiography.\n",
      "    *   Relevant clinical characteristics: cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic causes, primary and secondary causes, and clinical implications.\n",
      "    *   Patient's personal relevant history: heart failure, volume overload, impaired left ventricular function, pericardial tamponade, heart valve dysfunction, and other underlying conditions.\n",
      "2.  **Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**\n",
      "    *   Symptoms: chest pain, fever, and weakness.\n",
      "    *   Causes: fluid accumulation in the pericardial space (pericarditis and cardiac tamponade), inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis), and other possible causes (cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension).\n",
      "    *   Relevant clinical signs: chest pain, fever, and weakness, and signs of right heart failure.\n",
      "    *   Relevant laboratory data: elevated ESR and CRP levels, elevated troponin levels, normal ECG and echocardiogram results, and pericardial effusion.\n",

      "3.  **Pulmonary Consolidation:**\n",
      "    *   Symptoms: breath sounds, percussion note, and pleural rub.\n",
      "    *   Causes: inflammatory exudate, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate.\n",
      "    *   Relevant clinical signs: breath sounds, percussion note, and pleural rub.\n",
      "    *   Relevant laboratory data: blood from bronchial tree, inflammatory exudate, pus, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary infiltrate.\n",
      "    *   Relevant clinical characteristics: contributing factors, related entities, and clinical implications.\n",
      "    *   Patient's personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, and other underlying conditions.\n",
      "4.  **Atelectasis:**\n",
      "    *   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, and chest pain.\n",
      "    *   Causes: pleural effusion, pneumothorax, lung tumour, and other factors.\n",
      "    *   Relevant clinical signs: small volume linear shadows in the lung on chest x-rays and CT chest scans.\n",
      "    *   Relevant laboratory data: blood gas analysis, complete blood counts, and other laboratory tests.\n",
      "    *   Relevant clinical characteristics: causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis.\n",
      "    *   Patient's personal relevant history: pleural effusion, pneumothorax, lung tumour, and other underlying conditions.\n",
      "5.  **Pleural Abnormality:**\n",
      "    *   Symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, and coughing.\n",
      "    *   Causes: pneumonia, pneumothorax, and pulmonary tuberculosis.\n",
      "    *   Relevant clinical signs: pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and pleural thickening.\n",
      "    *   Relevant laboratory data: blood cultures, pleural fluid analysis, and other laboratory tests.\n",
      "    *   Relevant clinical characteristics: chest radiography, pneumonia, pneumothorax, and pulmonary tuberculosis.\n",
