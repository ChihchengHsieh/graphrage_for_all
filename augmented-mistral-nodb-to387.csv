## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object without additional text.

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.

## Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON 
COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph from earlier today from theoutside hospital.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  NG tube placement assess position.
FINDINGS:  In this patient with a large hiatal hernia the NG tube is seencoiled in the left upper abdomen though its tip extends superiorly into theintrathoracic portion of the stomach.  Basilar atelectasis and tiny effusionsare better assessed on outside hospital CT from earlier today.  The upperlungs remain well aerated.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  Bony structuresare intact with degenerative changes at the right AC joint.  Free air belowthe right hemidiaphragm is seen.
IMPRESSION:  NG tube coiled within the stomach with its tip in theintrathoracic portion of the stomach.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Consolidation Atelectasis.

## Report
INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
COMPARISONS:   to .
FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The exam islimited by significant soft tissue attenuation and AP lordotic positioning. Despite these limitations the lungs are well expanded and clear.  There is nofocal consolidation effusion pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly and aortictortuosity are unchanged since .  However the upper mediastinumappears wider than on prior exams possibly due to AP technique.
IMPRESSION:  Apparent upper mediastinal widening is likely secondary to APtechnique.  A repeat PA radiograph should be obtained.

## Report
INDICATION:  Hemodialysis line which was pulled.
COMPARISON:  .
TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinaland hilar contours are within normal limits.  Previously noted opacity withinthe right upper lobe has somewhat improved with residual linear opacitieslikely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis.  Additionally aeration of theleft lung base is improved and subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobeis noted.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Inferior venacava filter is partially imaged.
IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in aeration of the right upper lobe and leftlung base.  Minimal residual subsegmental atelectasis is noted in theseregions.  No hemodialysis catheter is identified.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: No lesion found.

TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph  and chest CT .
FINDINGS:
The cardiac mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Predominantly linearopacities within the left lower lobe likely reflect scarring andbronchiectasis with adjacent pleural thickening. More focal opacity within theperiphery of the left lung base may also reflect an area of scarring thoughinfection cannot be completely excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothoraxis seen.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  There are no acuteosseous abnormalities.

## Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
HISTORY:  Chest pain.
COMPARISONS:  .
TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  A PortACath terminates atthe cavoatrial junction.  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  Acalcified lymph node is seen along the aortopulmonary window.  The cardiacmediastinal and hilar contours do not appear significantly changed.  The lungvolumes are low.  There is persistent patchy opacification in the left lowerlobe which appears somewhat more dense and compressed perhaps coincidingwith differences in lung volumes rather than a true interval change however. In fact left basilar opacities are more similar to  wherelungs volumes were somewhat lower than on the more recent prior examination. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures areunremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  Persistent left basilar opacification suspected to representprimarily atelectasis.  However the possibility of superimposed pneumoniacould be considered in the appropriate clinical setting versus increasedatelectasis associated with low lung volumes.

## Report
EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
INDICATION:  Chest pain.
COMPARISON:  Radiographs and CT from .
TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
FINDINGS: 
The cardiac mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is nopleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A nodular density with cavitation along theright lower lobe abutting the hemidiaphragm is more distinctly visible butprobably decreased in size since the prior study now with smooth margins. This may represent a resolving pulmonary infarct but should be followed witheither radiography or CT within 6 months to reassess.
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
2. Persistent nodular density along the right hemidiaphragm suspected torepresent a small cavitating nodule associated with prior infarct.  Howeverfollowup is recommended with either radiography or CT within 6 months forsurveillance.

FINDINGS:  Single semierect portable view of the chest was obtained.  Opacityprojecting over the right mid to lower lung is likely due to pleural effusionwith overlying atelectasis underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  Ifwant to know full extent of pleural effusion consider decubitus views.  Thereis a nodular opacity projecting over the lateral right lower hemithorax mostlikely representing nipple shadow although attention at followup once pleuraleffusion resolved is suggested.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  Thecardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob iscalcified.

HISTORY:  yearold female status post fall.
COMPARISON:  None.
FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest demonstrate mild interstitial abnormalityand prominence of the pulmonary vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged and coronary arterycalcifications and stents are noted.  Median sternotomy wires are noted fromprior CABG and there is a singlelead pacemaker superimposed over the leftchest with lead terminating in the right ventricle.  The left pulmonary arteryappears enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No focalconsolidation is noted. No definite displaced rib fracture is seen.
IMPRESSION:1.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.2.  Left pulmonary arterial enlargement suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.3.  No definite displaced rib fracture. If there is continued clinicalconcern then a dedicated rib series is recommended.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

FINDINGS: 
The heart size is top normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.The lungs are hyperinflated otherwise no focal consolidations concerning forpneumonia are identified.  Mild left basilar linear atelectasis scarring isagain seen. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Incidental note ismade of a 9 mm lung nodule projecting over the right anterior second ribinterspace. Aortic annular calcifications are again noted. Old healed leftlower lobe rib fractures are stable.
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intrathoracic abnormalities identified. Hyperinflated lungs.
2. 9 mm lung nodule projecting over the anterior second right rib interspacewas not well seen on the prior exam. A CT may be helpful for furtherevaluation.

## Report
INDICATION:  Confusion.
COMPARISON:  .
UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post mediansternotomy with redemonstration of fracture of the most inferior wire. Patient is also status post CABG. Low lung volumes are present. There iscrowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Streaky opacities in the lungbases likely reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be completelyexcluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is no overtpulmonary edema.  Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are present.
IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  There islikely mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Infection at the lung bases cannot becompletely excluded and a repeat exam with increased inspiratory effort maybe useful.

FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Within the limitations of techniquethere is no definite abnormality of vasculature but there is patchy opacityin the left midtolower lung possibly pneumonia in the appropriate clinicalsetting.  The azygos vein appears mildly prominent.  There is no pleuraleffusion or pneumothorax.  The bones are probably demineralized.  There is aslight Sshaped thoracic spinal curvature.  
IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of pulmonary edema.  Mild prominence of theazygos vein could be a reflection of increased volume status however.  Patchyleft basilar opacity for which developing pneumonia could be considered.
