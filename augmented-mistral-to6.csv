 Pulmonary edema is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the lungs' interstitial spaces and alveoli, leading to impaired gas exchange. The diagnosis involves identifying its underlying etiology, which can be cardiogenic, non-cardiogenic, or high-altitude pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by heart failure, while non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by various conditions such as sepsis, pneumonia, and ARDS. High-altitude pulmonary edema is caused by the accumulation of fluid in the alveolar spaces of the lungs due to the decrease in atmospheric pressure at high altitudes.

The clinical features of cardiogenic pulmonary edema include dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and crackles on auscultation. Chest radiographs may show characteristic findings such as vascular congestion, cardiomegaly, and fluid in the interstitial spaces. Echocardiography is a valuable diagnostic tool for assessing cardiac function and evaluating cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema may present with fever, tachycardia, and peripheral edema. Chest radiographs may show bilateral infiltrates and pleural effusions. Pulmonary function tests, such as the measurement of total lung capacity and diffusing capacity, can help differentiate between cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

High-altitude pulmonary edema is characterized by dyspnea, cough, and chest tightness. Chest radiographs may show bilateral infiltrates and pleural effusions. Descent to lower altitudes and oxygen therapy are the primary treatments for high-altitude pulmonary edema.

A patient's personal relevant history for the etiological diagnosis of pulmonary edema includes a history of heart failure, lung diseases, and kidney or heart issues. Diagnostic tools such as chest radiographs and echocardiograms are essential for identifying the presence of fluid in the lungs and assessing heart function.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

 Pulmonary edema is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the lungs' interstitial spaces and alveoli, leading to impaired gas exchange. The diagnosis involves identifying its underlying etiology, which can be cardiogenic, non-cardiogenic, or high-altitude pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by heart failure, while non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by various conditions such as sepsis, pneumonia, and ARDS. High-altitude pulmonary edema is caused by the accumulation of fluid in the alveolar spaces of the lungs due to the decrease in atmospheric pressure at high altitudes.

The clinical features of cardiogenic pulmonary edema include dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and crackles on auscultation. Chest radiographs may show characteristic findings such as vascular congestion, cardiomegaly, and fluid in the interstitial spaces. Echocardiography is a valuable diagnostic tool for assessing cardiac function and evaluating cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema may present with fever, tachycardia, and peripheral edema. Chest radiographs may show bilateral infiltrates and pleural effusions. Pulmonary function tests, such as the measurement of total lung capacity and diffusing capacity, can help differentiate between cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

High-altitude pulmonary edema is characterized by dyspnea, cough, and chest tightness. Chest radiographs may show bilateral infiltrates and pleural effusions. Descent to lower altitudes and oxygen therapy are the primary treatments for high-altitude pulmonary edema.

A patient's personal relevant history for the etiological diagnosis of pulmonary edema includes a history of heart failure, lung diseases, and kidney or heart issues. Diagnostic tools such as chest radiographs and echocardiograms are essential for identifying the presence of fluid in the lungs and assessing heart function.

- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.
- Please ensure that any JSON output does not contain unescaped double quotes within strings. All double quotes within text fields should be escaped using a backslash ("") to maintain valid JSON format. Additionally, double-check that the JSON syntax is well-formed and adheres to proper formatting guidelines.
