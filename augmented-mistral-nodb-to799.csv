- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object without additional text.
- You only return the speculated values in JSON format without additional content.

- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object without additional text.
- You only return the speculated values in JSON format without additional content.

## Report
INDICATION:  Recent thoracic aorta repair now with nausea and shoulder pain. Please evaluate postoperative appearance.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from .
FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are decreased compared to the prior study from with elevation of the minor fissure which contains either asmall amount of fluid or is thickened.  There are moderate bilateral pleuraleffusions difficult to quantify but likely increased although decreased lungvolumes are a confounding factor in evaluating for change.  Bibasilarassociated parenchymal opacities could represent compressive atelectasisalthough concomitant infection in either lung base is not excluded.  There ispulmonary vascular congestion without frank interstitial edema.  The heartsize is difficult to assess but appears moderately enlarged.  The mediastinalcontours are unchanged with widening of the mediastinum attributable to knowndilatation of the thoracic aorta.  Midline sternotomy wires are intact. Scattered mediastinal clips are again seen.  Multilevel degenerative changesof the thoracolumbar spine are noted.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Low lung volumes with persistent moderate bilateral pleural effusionsprobably increased somewhat but difficult to quantify.  Pleural effusionscould be better assessed with decubitus views if needed clinically.
2.  Bibasilar lower lung opacities possibly secondary to compressiveatelectasis although concomitant infection in either lung base is notexcluded.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette Consolidation Atelectasis Pleural abnormality.

EXAMINATION:  CHEST PORTABLE AP
INDICATION:  History: F with post intubation
TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 
FINDINGS: 
Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation.  The endotracheal tube tipterminates approximately 6 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube tip is withinthe stomach.  Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged but unchanged. Assessment of the mediastinal and hilar contours is limited.  Pulmonaryvasculature is not engorged.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities may reflectareas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Marked degenerative changes are noted involving the right glenohumeral joint.
IMPRESSION: 
Limited examination due to patient rotation.  Endotracheal and enteric tubesin standard positions.  Streaky bibasilar opacities likely atelectasis.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Consolidation Atelectasis.

HISTORY:  Nausea.
COMPARISON:  Multiple priors the most recent dated .
FINDINGS:  There is a severe levoconcave scoliosis of the thoracic spine.  Thecompensatory dextroconcave scoliosis of the lumbar spine is not included onthis radiograph as in priors.  The lungs however remain clear withoutconsolidation or edema.  Evidence of prior median sternotomy and CABG noted. The cardiac silhouette size is stable.  There is suggestion of bluntingposteriorly of the left costophrenic angle which has been noted on prior examsmay be due to chronic effusion or scarring.  No right effusion is noted. There is no pneumothorax.  No displaced fractures are evident.

## Report
EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
COMPARISON:  .
FINDINGS:  There is persistent blunting of the right costophrenic anglepossibly due to chronic right pleural effusion andor scarring.  Areas oflinear scarringatelectasis are seen scattered over the right lung.  Nodefinite new focal consolidation is seen.  The left hilar contour appearsminimally more prominent as compared to the prior study which may in partrelate to technique.  However given history of lymphoma this could befurther evaluated on nonurgent chest CT.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The aortais calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
IMPRESSION:  Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to asmall chronic pleural effusionpleural thickening.  No definite focalconsolidation seen.

- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object without additional text.
- You only return the speculated values in JSON format without additional content.

## Report
FINAL ADDENDUMADDENDUM  There is a partially imaged ovoid lucency projecting over the medialproximal left humeral shaft measuring approximately 5.4 X 0.9 cm.  Thisfinding is not well assessed on this study and it is unclear whether thisartifactual or a lucent bone lesion.  It is unlikely related to patient'strauma however recommend dedicated imaging of the left humerus either todayor in the near future for further evaluation if this finding is not alreadyknown and imaged elsewhere.

## Report
HISTORY:  Chest pain with inspiration.
TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
COMPARISON:  None.
FINDINGS:
Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouettewhich is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonaryedema is demonstrated.  There is a possible small left pleural effusion. Patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region is likely atelectasis given the lowlung volumes but an early pneumonia is not completely excluded.  There is nopneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
IMPRESSION:
Low lung volumes.  Minimal patchy retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasisthough infection cannot be completely excluded.  Probable trace left pleuraleffusion.

FINDINGS:  Compared to the most recent prior study of  the appearanceof the chest is unchanged.  The patient is status post median sternotomy withmultiple mediastinal surgical clips compatible with prior CABG.  A mitralvalve prosthesis is unchanged in position or appearance.  The cardiacsilhouette is mildly enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal contours are withinnormal limits and stable with minimal calcification of the aortic knob.  Mildpulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged.  No significant pleural effusionis present.  On the lateral radiograph there is opacification along thefissure of the left lung corresponding to left basilar opacification on thefrontal radiograph.  This finding is unchanged from the prior study and mayrepresent partial lobar collapse or fluid trapped within the fissure.  Nopneumothorax is detected.
IMPRESSION:  Persistent mild edema and left lower lobe atelectasis vs fluid inthe fissure.  Unchanged from . Bronchial obstruction cannot beexcluded.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object without additional text.
- You only return the speculated values in JSON format without additional content.
