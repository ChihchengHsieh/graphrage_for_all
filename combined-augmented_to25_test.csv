# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": 99.0}


Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

**Summary of Lesions: Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette, Pulmonary Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Abnormality**

**Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, chest pain, palpitations, and coughing up blood
*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

**Summary of Lesions: Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette, Pulmonary Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Abnormality**

**Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, chest pain, palpitations, and coughing up blood
*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, lung cancer, and surfactant deficiency
*   Clinical signs: lung collapse, increased cardiothoracic ratio, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax
*   Laboratory data: chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, age, previous surgical history, and respiratory conditions

**Pleural Abnormality:**

*   Symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and weight loss

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": 99.0}


Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

**Summary of Lesions: Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette, Pulmonary Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Abnormality**

**Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, chest pain, palpitations, and coughing up blood
*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": 99.0}


Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

**Summary of Lesions: Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette, Pulmonary Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Abnormality**

**Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, chest pain, palpitations, and coughing up blood
*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, lung cancer, and surfactant deficiency
*   Clinical signs: lung collapse, increased cardiothoracic ratio, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax
*   Laboratory data: chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, age, previous surgical history, and respiratory conditions

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

**Summary of Lesions: Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette, Pulmonary Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Abnormality**

**Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, chest pain, palpitations, and coughing up blood
*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, lung cancer, and surfactant deficiency
*   Clinical signs: lung collapse, increased cardiothoracic ratio, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax
*   Laboratory data: chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, age, previous surgical history, and respiratory conditions

**Pleural Abnormality:**

*   Symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pleural effusion, pneumoperitoneum, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and symptomatic pneumothorax
*   Clinical signs: pleural effusion, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and pneumoperitoneum

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range

## Speculated Values
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": 99.0}


Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

**Summary of Lesions: Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette, Pulmonary Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Abnormality**

**Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, chest pain, palpitations, and coughing up blood
*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, lung cancer, and surfactant deficiency
*   Clinical signs: lung collapse, increased cardiothoracic ratio, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax
*   Laboratory data: chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, age, previous surgical history, and respiratory conditions

**Pleural Abnormality:**

*   Symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pleural effusion, pneumoperitoneum, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and symptomatic pneumothorax
*   Clinical signs: pleural effusion, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and pneumoperitoneum
*   Laboratory data: pleural fluid analysis, blood tests, chest radiography, CT scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, lung cancer or other malignancies, medical history, family history, and occupational and environmental history

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

**Summary of Lesions: Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette, Pulmonary Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Abnormality**

**Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, chest pain, palpitations, and coughing up blood
*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, lung cancer, and surfactant deficiency
*   Clinical signs: lung collapse, increased cardiothoracic ratio, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax
*   Laboratory data: chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, age, previous surgical history, and respiratory conditions

**Pleural Abnormality:**

*   Symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pleural effusion, pneumoperitoneum, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and symptomatic pneumothorax
*   Clinical signs: pleural effusion, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and pneumoperitoneum

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

**Summary of Lesions: Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette, Pulmonary Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Abnormality**

**Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, chest pain, palpitations, and coughing up blood
*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, lung cancer, and surfactant deficiency
*   Clinical signs: lung collapse, increased cardiothoracic ratio, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax
*   Laboratory data: chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, age, previous surgical history, and respiratory conditions

**Pleural Abnormality:**

*   Symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pleural effusion, pneumoperitoneum, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and symptomatic pneumothorax
*   Clinical signs: pleural effusion, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and pneumoperitoneum

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

**Summary of Lesions: Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette, Pulmonary Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Abnormality**

**Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, chest pain, palpitations, and coughing up blood
*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, lung cancer, and surfactant deficiency
*   Clinical signs: lung collapse, increased cardiothoracic ratio, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax
*   Laboratory data: chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, age, previous surgical history, and respiratory conditions

**Pleural Abnormality:**

*   Symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pleural effusion, pneumoperitoneum, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and symptomatic pneumothorax
*   Clinical signs: pleural effusion, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and pneumoperitoneum
*   Laboratory data: pleural fluid analysis, blood tests, chest radiography, CT scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, lung cancer or other malignancies, medical history, family history, and occupational and environmental history

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": 99.0}


Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

COMPARISON:  .
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hyperglycemia assess for infection.
FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs appearclear bilaterally aside from mild basilar platelike atelectasis.
