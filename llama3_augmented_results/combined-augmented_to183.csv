# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Json Object

## Expected Output
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Age"": 69, ""Heartrate"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (%)"": 99.0}


According to the following report, what can be the value of features provided in the json object? The json object provides the requested feature and their data types. Try to speculate the value instead of saying you don't know or not mentioned. Please return the values in json format as the json object used for indicating data types. And, don't forget the request of specific JSON format in the system prompt, so the returned json object should be a json string in the **description** in the **points**.
And, don't generated repetitive results.
IMPORTANT: Please ensure that your response is not more than 5000 tokens.

## Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  Question acute process.
COMPARISONS:  .
TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. There is a duallead pacemaker with leads again terminating in the rightatrium and ventricle respectively.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorticarch is calcified.  The cardiac mediastinal and hilar contours appearunchanged.  There is a widespread mild interstitial abnormality which is ofuncertain chronicity.  This is most confluent in the lower lungs and insubpleural regions.  Although a component of this may be due to pulmonaryvascular congestion intrinsic interstitial lung disease is an additionalconsideration to consider.  Streaky left basilar opacities suggestatelectasis not significantly changed.  The bones are probably demineralized.Mild degenerative changes are noted along the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Mild interstitial abnormality most prominent along costophrenic angleswhich could be seen with a component of mild vascular congestion but thepossibility of a more chronic abnormality such as intrinsic lung diseaseshould also be considered.  
2.  Patchy left basilar atelectasis not significantly changed and accordinglysuggestive of chronic scarring.

## Report
HISTORY:  Nearsyncope.  
TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph  and chest CT .
FINDINGS:
Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  The lungs are hyperinflated with severeemphysema.  Punctate calcified granulomas are seen within the lung bases. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect scarring or subsegmentalatelectasis.  Residual patchy opacity within the left upper lobe likelyreflects scarring as seen on the prior chest CT.  No new consolidationpleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Scarring within the lungapices is again noted.  There is diffuse demineralization of the osseousstructures.
IMPRESSION:
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Severe emphysema.  Residual left upperlobe opacity likely reflects scarring as seen on the prior chest CT withbibasilar linear opacities either reflecting subsegmental atelectasis orscarring.
