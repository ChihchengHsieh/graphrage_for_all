# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

## Report
WET READ:   2:55 PM Nondisplaced right  and  lateral rib fractures.  Retrocardiac atelectasis.  No definite radiographic evidence for pneumonia.                                  HISTORY:  Fall with subdural hematoma.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

## Report
HISTORY:  Sepsis and cough.
COMPARISON:  .
FINDINGS: Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained.  The lungs are wellexpanded.  Left basal opacity has progressed and could reflect a focus ofaspiration or pneumonia.  Additional focal opacities in the lateral right midlung and medial right lower lung could reflect additional sites of infectionor aspiration.  Interstitial prominence is greater than on the prior and acomponent of pulmonary edema superimposed upon existing chronic lung diseaseis suspected.  No pneumothorax is seen with perhaps trace bilateral pleuraleffusions.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Likely multifocal pneumonia either aspiration or infectious withpresumed pulmonary edema superimposed on a background of chronic lung disease.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": 99.0}


Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

## Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  Question acute process.
COMPARISONS:  .
TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. There is a duallead pacemaker with leads again terminating in the rightatrium and ventricle respectively.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorticarch is calcified.  The cardiac mediastinal and hilar contours appearunchanged.  There is a widespread mild interstitial abnormality which is ofuncertain chronicity.  This is most confluent in the lower lungs and insubpleural regions.  Although a component of this may be due to pulmonaryvascular congestion intrinsic interstitial lung disease is an additionalconsideration to consider.  Streaky left basilar opacities suggestatelectasis not significantly changed.  The bones are probably demineralized.Mild degenerative changes are noted along the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Mild interstitial abnormality most prominent along costophrenic angleswhich could be seen with a component of mild vascular congestion but thepossibility of a more chronic abnormality such as intrinsic lung diseaseshould also be considered.  
2.  Patchy left basilar atelectasis not significantly changed and accordinglysuggestive of chronic scarring.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Pulmonary edema Pleural abnormality.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

## Report

TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph  and chest CT .
FINDINGS:
Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  The lungs are hyperinflated with severeemphysema.  Punctate calcified granulomas are seen within the lung bases. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect scarring or subsegmentalatelectasis.  Residual patchy opacity within the left upper lobe likelyreflects scarring as seen on the prior chest CT.  No new consolidationpleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Scarring within the lungapices is again noted.  There is diffuse demineralization of the osseousstructures.
IMPRESSION:
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Severe emphysema.  Residual left upperlobe opacity likely reflects scarring as seen on the prior chest CT withbibasilar linear opacities either reflecting subsegmental atelectasis orscarring.

**Summary of Lesions: Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette, Pulmonary Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Abnormality**

**Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, chest pain, palpitations, and coughing up blood
*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""numerical""}

## Healthy Patient Feature Range
{""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": ""60-100"", ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": ""75-100""}

## Speculated Values
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Heartrate (beats per minute)"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (mmHg)"": 99.0}


Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Don't miss any keyword in the **Data Type** when returning speculated values.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 5000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' 
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
