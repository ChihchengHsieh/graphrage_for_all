# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.

Right base opacity could be due to atelectasisalthough consolidation potentially due to infection or aspiration is notexcluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion orpneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are not wellassessed due to the low lung volumes although mediastinal contours areunremarkable and similar to prior..  Chronic deformity at the right shoulderis re demonstrated.  The study is suboptimal for the assessment of ribfractures.
IMPRESSION: 
Persistent low lung volumes and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Rightbase opacity could be due to atelectasis or consolidation.
Study limited for the assessment of rib fractures.  If there is clinicalconcern for such CT is more sensitive and should be considered.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Data Type

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

Based on the following ""Report"", determine the potential values for the keywords listed in the 'Data Type' JSON object, which specifies the required keywords and their data types.

## IMPORTANT
- Return the results in JSON format, adhering to the data types defined in the 'Data Type' JSON object.
- Make sure to include all keywords in the ""Data Type"" when returning speculated values, especially when both boolean and numerical keywords are required. For example, if the keywords include both ""Increased Cardiothoracic ratio"" and ""Cardiothoracic ratio,"" ensure that neither is missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 12000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer rather than stating 'unknown' or 'not mentioned,' Don't say ""I am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data."".
- Avoid generating repetitive results.
- Avoid returning repetitive keywords.
- Ensure the output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format outlined in the system prompt. The JSON object for keywords must be included as a string (enclosed in double quotes) under the 'description' field within the 'points' object.
- For numerical keywords, refer to the 'Healthy Patient Feature Range' JSON object for guidance. However, the values do not need to fall strictly within these ranges, as not all patients are healthy—just ensure the values are realistic.
- Your response must a JSON object (Can be list or map/dictionary) without additional text.
