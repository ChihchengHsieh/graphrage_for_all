# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 1000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 1000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 1000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

## Report
INDICATION:  Confusion.
COMPARISON:  .
UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post mediansternotomy with redemonstration of fracture of the most inferior wire. Patient is also status post CABG. Low lung volumes are present. There iscrowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Streaky opacities in the lungbases likely reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be completelyexcluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is no overtpulmonary edema.  Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are present.
IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  There islikely mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Infection at the lung bases cannot becompletely excluded and a repeat exam with increased inspiratory effort maybe useful.

## Report
WET READ:   5:38 AM 1. Mild pulmonary edema.  2. Opacities in the left upper lobe and right lung base which could reflect atelectasis or focal edema although cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting.  3. Cardiomegaly.                                 INDICATION:  History: M with CHF sob   Eval for volume status
TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral images of the chest.
COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from  and.
FINDINGS: 
The study is somewhat limited due to motion artifact. The lungs are wellexpanded. Indistinct vasculature and cardiomegaly suggests mild pulmonaryedema although some of the haziness could be due to technique. Hazy opacitiesare seen in the left upper lung and right lung base which could reflectatelectasis or focal edema although cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration inthe right clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
2. Opacities in the left upper lobe and right lung base which could reflectatelectasis or focal edema although cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration inthe right clinical setting.  Reassessment after diuresis is recommended

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 1000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 1000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Json Object 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate"": ""numerical"", ""Age"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (%)"": ""numerical""}

## Expected Output
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Age"": 69, ""Heartrate"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (%)"": 99.0}


According to the following report, what can be the value of features provided in the json object? The json object provides the requested feature and their data types. Try to speculate the value instead of saying you don't know or not mentioned. Please return the values in json format as the json object used for indicating data types. And, don't forget the request of specific JSON format in the system prompt, so the returned json object should be a json string in the **description** in the **points**.
And, don't generated repetitive results.

## Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
HISTORY:  Cough and lower extremity edema.
COMPARISONS:  .
TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP upright and lateral.
FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Within the limitations of techniquethere is no definite abnormality of vasculature but there is patchy opacityin the left midtolower lung possibly pneumonia in the appropriate clinicalsetting.  The azygos vein appears mildly prominent.  There is no pleuraleffusion or pneumothorax.  The bones are probably demineralized.  There is aslight Sshaped thoracic spinal curvature.  
IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of pulmonary edema.  Mild prominence of theazygos vein could be a reflection of increased volume status however.  Patchyleft basilar opacity for which developing pneumonia could be considered.

## Report
INDICATION:  M with dyspnea and cough   ro acute process
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.
COMPARISON:   chest xray.   chest CT.
FINDINGS: 
The lungs are hyperinflated but clear of consolidation.  Linear opacity in theright mid to upper lung is compatible with scarring as well as changes of theposterior right ribs which are chronic.  Blunting of the right lateralposterior costophrenic angle is chronic potentially due to scarring or traceeffusion.  Blunting of the left posterior costophrenic angle suggests smallpleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.Prominent retrocardiac opacity on the right is compatible with a neoesophagus.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: 
New trace left pleural effusion.  Otherwise no significant interval change.

**Summary of Lesions: Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette, Pulmonary Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Abnormality**

**Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, chest pain, palpitations, and coughing up blood
*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, lung cancer, and surfactant deficiency
*   Clinical signs: lung collapse, increased cardiothoracic ratio, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax
*   Laboratory data: chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, age, previous surgical history, and respiratory conditions

**Pleural Abnormality:**

*   Symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pleural effusion, pneumoperitoneum, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and symptomatic pneumothorax
*   Clinical signs: pleural effusion, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and pneumoperitoneum
*   Laboratory data: pleural fluid analysis, blood tests, chest radiography, CT scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, lung cancer or other malignancies, medical history, family history, and occupational and environmental history

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 1000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Json Object 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate"": ""numerical"", ""Age"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (%)"": ""numerical""}

## Expected Output
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Age"": 69, ""Heartrate"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (%)"": 99.0}


According to the following report, what can be the value of features provided in the json object? The json object provides the requested feature and their data types. Try to speculate the value instead of saying you don't know or not mentioned. Please return the values in json format as the json object used for indicating data types. And, don't forget the request of specific JSON format in the system prompt, so the returned json object should be a json string in the **description** in the **points**.
And, don't generated repetitive results. 
IMPORTANT: Please ensure that your response is not more than 5000 tokens.


## Report
INDICATION:  yearold male with nausea vomiting and dizziness.

PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contoursare normal.  The lungs are well expanded and clear without consolidationpleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Again seen is a moderatesized hiatalhernia.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: No lesion found.
AGE: 68.
GENDER: M.
BODY TEMPERATURE FAHRENHEIT: 98.4.

## IMPORTANT
- Please ensure that all keywords in the JSON object are not missed.
- Return actual values instead of data types.
- Please keep your responses concise, with a maximum length of 1000 tokens.
- If uncertain, speculate the value rather than stating that you cannot answer.
