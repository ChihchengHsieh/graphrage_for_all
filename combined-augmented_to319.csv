# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

According to the following report, what can be the value of features provided in the json object? The json object provides the requested feature and their data types. Try to speculate the value instead of saying you don't know or not mentioned. Please return the values in json format as the json object used for indicating data types. And, don't forget the request of specific JSON format in the system prompt, so the returned json object should be a json string in the **description** in the **points**.
And, don't generated repetitive results. 
IMPORTANT: Please ensure that your response is not more than 5000 tokens.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Report
WET READ:    8:09 AM  1. Possible right lower lobe pneumonia or atelectasis. Alternatively pulmonary embolism could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. If further evaluation for potential pulmonary embolism is desired chest CTA is the appropriate study.  If the patient is treated for pneumonia recommend followup radiograph in 6 weeks to assess for changes. 2. Atelectasis and scarring in the lower left lung are unchanged.WET READ VERSION     1:06 AM  1. Subtle right basilar opacities could correspond to a developing infection in the appropriate clinical setting. If the patient is treated for pneumonia recommend followup radiograph in 6 weeks to assess for changes. 2. Atelectasis and scarring in the lower left lung are unchanged.                                 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
INDICATION:  M with co SOB    PNA
TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
COMPARISON:   chest radiographs outside hospital chest CT
FINDINGS: 
There are new subtle right basilar opacities.  Linear atelectasis in the midleft lung is similar.  Subtle l left ower lobe opacities likely correspondingto scarring or atelectasis seen on recent outside hospital CT are alsounchanged.  There is possibly a trace left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Heart size is normaland cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are stable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Possible right lower lobe pneumonia or atelectasis.  Alternativelypulmonary embolism could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. If further evaluation for potential pulmonary embolism is desired chest CTAis the appropriate study.  If the patient is treated for pneumonia recommendfollowup radiograph in 6 weeks to assess for changes.2. Atelectasis and scarring in the lower left lung are unchanged.
