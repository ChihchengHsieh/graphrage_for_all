# Methodology

## Overview
In this section, we describe the methodology used to augment and generate synthetic data for a clinical dataset using GraphRAG.


## GraphRAG Model
The graphrag is originally developed by Microsoft, which works with the OpenAI API in Azure. We then take it and modify it to w



## Evaluation
The generated synthetic data was evaluated using the following metrics:
1. **Accuracy**: Measured the correctness of the synthetic data.
2. **Diversity**: Assessed the variety in the generated data.
3. **Realism**: Evaluated how realistic the synthetic data is compared to the original dataset.

## Conclusion
The methodology outlined above demonstrates the use of GraphRAG to effectively augment and generate synthetic data for clinical datasets, ensuring high accuracy, diversity, and realism.
