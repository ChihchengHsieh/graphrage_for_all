usually seen on chest x-rays as small volume linear shadows, usually peripherally or at the lung bases. the underlying cause (such as a lung tumour or pleural effusion) may also be visible. lobar collapse will have a more typical and appearance based on the lobe involved, whereas atelectasis can be more eccentric in position and appearance.ct chestct allows a more accurate depiction of the involved lung. the dependent lung can be affected by subsegmental collapse just because of lying down (particularly if the patient has been supine for a long period of time, or they are under general anaesthesia). this part of the lung is easier to visualise because it is hidden behind the diaphragm on a frontal chest x-rayct is often helpful to determine the cause or confirm that there is no proximal obstruction, though most cases of atelectasis are diagnosed and managed without ct investigation.\nincoming links\narticles:\nair-bronchogram (summary)\nrelated articles: education: medical

inhalation, and occasionally during exhalation. they are usually heard only with a stethoscope (\"on auscultation\"). pulmonary crackles are abnormal breath sounds that were formerly referred to as rales.\nbilateral crackles refers to the presence of crackles in both lungs. basal crackles are crackles apparently originating in or near the base of the lung. bibasal crackles, also called bilateral basal crackles, are crackles heard at the bases of both the left and right lungs.\ncrackles are caused by the \"popping open\" of small airways and alveoli collapsed by fluid, exudate, or lack of aeration during expiration.\ncrackles can be heard in patients with pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, acute bronchitis, bronchiectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), interstitial lung disease or post thoracotomy or metastasis ablation. pulmonary edema secondary to left-sided congestive heart failure can also cause crackles.\n== terminology ==\nrene laennec adopted the existing word rales (which has been translated as \"rattles\", 'groans\" and otherwise) to describe the added breath sounds that are now referred to as \"crackles\". he described them using unusual daily examples, such as \"whistling of little birds\", \"crackling of salt on a heated dish\", \"cooing of the woodpidgeon\", etc., but he soon realized that he was unable to use the term in front of his patients because it conjured the association of le rale de la mort, which translates to \"the death rattle\", the noise that people who are about to die make when they can no longer clear secretions. therefore, at the bedside, he used the latin word rhonchus, which originally meant a 'snore'. that was not clearly understood by his translator, john forbes, and the terminology became very confusing after the publication in the 1830s of forbes's english translation of laennec's de l'auscultation mediate. the difficulty of translating rale itself had been remarked upon in a british review of laennec's work in 1820.\nthe terminology of rales and rhonchi in english remained variable until 1977, when a standardization was established by the american thoracic society and american college of chest physicians. as a result, the term rales was abandoned, and crackles became its recommended substitute. the term rales is still common in english-language medical literature, but cognizance of the ats\/chest guidelines calls for crackles.\n== sound ==\ncrackles are caused by explosive opening of small airways and are discontinuous, nonmusical, and brief. crackles are more common during the inspiratory than the expiratory phase of breathing, but they may be heard during the expiratory phase.\ncrackles are often described as fine, medium, and coarse. they can also be characterized as to their timing: fine crackles are usually late-inspiratory, whereas coarse crackles are early inspiratory.\nfine crackles are soft, high-pitched, and very brief. this sound can be simulated by rolling a strand of hair between one's fingers near the ears or by moistening one's thumb and index finger and separating them near the ears. their presence usually indicates an interstitial process, such as pulmonary fibrosis or congestive heart failure. the sounds from interstitial pulmonary fibrosis have been described as sounding like opening a velcro fastener.\ncoarse crackles are somewhat louder, lower in pitch, and last longer than fine crackles. their presence usually indicates an airway disease, such as bronchiectasis.\nthey can also be described as unilateral or bilateral, as well as dry or moist\/wet.\n== associated diagnoses ==\ncrackles are often associated with inflammation or infection of the small bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.\ncrackles that do not clear after a cough may indicate pulmonary edema or fluid in the alveoli due to heart failure, pulmonary fibrosis, or acute

{"id":"bfedb48bcb2d32dd3d7321cd26f3cc1f","chunk":"asbestos-related diseases are disorders of the lung and pleura caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibres. asbestos-related diseases include non-malignant disorders such as asbestosis (pulmonary fibrosis due to asbestos), diffuse pleural thickening, pleural plaques, pleural effusion, rounded atelectasis and malignancies such as lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma.\npeople who worked in jobs with high asbestos dust exposure are at the highest risk of developing asbestos-related disease. however, exposure to asbestos may also occur in the worker's home due to dust that has accumulated on the worker's clothing (para-occupational exposure). asbestos-related diseases can also occur as a result of non-occupational, environmental exposure. asbestos was extensively used in many building materials, therefore large quantities of asbestos still remain in buildings that were built prior to the restriction of asbestos use that applies in many countries. the weathering and aging of such buildings may cause asbestos fragments to be released in the air and create a potential hazard. anyone who disturbs the asbestos-containing material during home maintenance and renovation can be affected, although the exact risks are difficult to quantify.\n== pathophysiology ==\ninhaled asbestos fibres enter the upper and lower respiratory tracts when asbestos is released into the air. some of the inhaled fibers are cleared by the mucociliary clearance mechanism but long thin asbestos fibers may reach the lower airways and alveoli, and can be retained in the lungs for many years. amphibole fibers are not cleared as effectively as serpentines and therefore accumulate more readily in the distal lung parenchyma. asbestos fibres are recognised by the lungs as foreign bodies and cause the activation of the lung's local immune system leading to inflammation, cell and tissue damage. in the long term, this can lead to fibrosis, or rarely to malignancy. from the lungs, some asbestos fibres (mainly short fibres) can also migrate to pleural and peritoneal (abdominal) spaces.\n== non-malignant asbestos-related pleural diseases ==\nbenign asbestos-related pleural abnormalities encompass four types of pleural changes:\npleural plaques\ndiffuse pleural thickening\nbenign asbestos pleural effusions\nrounded atelectasis (folded lung)\nthe pleura appears to be more sensitive than the lung parenchyma to the effects of asbestos fibres. thus asbestos-related pleural diseases can result from much lower doses than the fibrotic changes in the lung.\n=== pleural plaques ===\npleural plaques are the most common manifestation of asbestos exposure, affecting up to 58% of asbestos-exposed workers. the prevalence among the general population exposed environmentally ranges from 0.53 to 8%. pleural plaques are discrete circumscribed areas of hyaline fibrosis (patches of thickening) of the parietal pleura and rarely the visceral pleura that develop 20 to 40 years after first exposure. over time, usually more than 30 years, they often become partly calcified. they consist of mature collagen fibers arranged in an open basket-weave pattern and are covered by flattened or cuboidal mesothelial cells. they have a white or pale yellow shaggy appearance and are typically distributed on the posterolateral chest wall, diaphragm, and mediastinal pleura. the number and size varies. pleural plaques are typically asymptomatic, however, there is still some controversy on this topic. an association between pleural plaques and chest pain has been reported, but this has not been confirmed in more recent studies. similarly, an association between pleural plaques and a restrictive impairment with diminished diffusing capacity on pulmonary function testing has been described. this has not been a consistent finding and it has been postulated that this might be related to undetected early fibrosis. the pathogenesis of pleural plaques remains uncertain. the most likely explanation is that asbestos fibres reach

{"id":"3625259835cfe0f63ede76cbf361175d","chunk":"flat-chested kitten syndrome (fcks) is a disorder in cats wherein kittens develop a compression of the thorax (chest\/ribcage) caused by lung collapse. this is a soft-tissue problem and is not caused by vertebral or bony malformation. however, lung collapse can be a secondary symptom caused by bony deformity affecting the thorax such as pectus excavatum. in mild cases, the underside of the chest becomes flattened (hence the name of the condition); in extreme cases the entire thorax is flattened, looking as if the kitten has been stepped on. the kitten will appear to go from normal to flat in the space of about two to three hours, and will usually then stabilise. fcks is frequently misdiagnosed as pectus excavatum due to inadequate veterinary literature or lack of experience with the condition on the part of the clinician.\nfcks is most frequently caused by collapsed lungs (and not as formerly believed, by a muscle spasm in the intercostal muscles). there are numerous causes for lung collapse, and therefore numerous causes for fcks. one possible cause for flat chestedness that develops soon after birth is atelectasis.\ncauses of atelectasis include insufficient attempts at respiration by the newborn, bronchial obstruction, or absence of surfactant (a substance secreted by alveoli that coats the lungs and prevents the surfaces from sticking together). lack of surfactant reduces the surface area available for effective gas exchange causing lung collapse if severe. there can be many reasons for atelectasis in kittens, but probably the most common cause is prematurity. newborn atelectasis would not be unusual in a very large litter of kittens (such as 10), where the size of the litter may lead all the kittens to be small and mildly underdeveloped.\nunlike human babies, kittens are born very immature: blind, deaf, the intestinal tract not fully developed etc., so even slight prematurity may tip them over the edge from being viable to non viable. many fcks kittens may have fallen just the wrong side of this boundary in their development at the time of birth. further, if a kitten does not scream or open its lungs well enough at birth, even if it is fully mature and has sufficient surfactant, it may end up with atelectasis. patches of atelectasis in the lungs mean that part of a lung is not operating properly. if the kitten goes to sleep and its respiratory rate drops, the patches of atelectasis can slowly expand until large areas of the lung collapse and cannot be reinflated. good advice to any breeder therefore would be to ensure that kittens cry loudly when they are born, to make sure that the airways are clear, but also that the lungs expand as fully as possible. (this was the reason newborn babies were always held upside down immediately after birth (so that any residual fluid drains downwards) and smacked to make them cry strongly.)\nsome kittens suffer from congenital 'secondary' atelectasis, which presents shortly after birth. there have been no reports of kittens born flat (primary atelectasis). hyaline membrane disease is a type of respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn in which there is formation of a hyaline-like membrane lining the terminal respiratory passages, and this may also be a (rarer) cause of fcks. pressure from outside the lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well as obstruction of lung air passages by mucus resulting from various infections and lung diseases - which may explain the development of fcks in older kittens (e.g. 10 days old) who are not strong enough to breathe through even a light mucus, or who may have inhaled milk during suckling.\ntumors and inhaled objects (possible if bedding contains loose fluff) can also cause obstruction or irritation of the airway, leading to lung collapse and secondary atelectasis. in an older cat the intercostal muscles are so well developed, and the ribs rigid enough that the ribcage will not flatten if the lung collapses: in kittens the bones are much more

{"id":"d0e58f7d3962d661994005e6c26d467f","chunk":"atelectasis is the partial collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. it is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. it is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume, as distinct from pulmonary consolidation, in which they are filled with liquid. it is often referred to informally as a collapsed lung, although more accurately it usually involves only a partial collapse, and that ambiguous term is also informally used for a fully collapsed lung caused by a pneumothorax.\nit is a very common finding in chest x-rays and other radiological studies, and may be caused by normal exhalation or by various medical conditions. although frequently described as a collapse of lung tissue, atelectasis is not synonymous with a pneumothorax, which is a more specific condition that can cause atelectasis. acute atelectasis may occur as a post-operative complication or as a result of surfactant deficiency. in premature babies, this leads to infant respiratory distress syndrome.\nthe term uses combining forms of atel- + ectasis, from greek: ateles, \"incomplete\" + ektasis, \"extension\".\n== signs and symptoms ==\nmay have no signs and symptoms or they may include:\ncough, but not prominent;\nchest pain (not common);\nbreathing difficulty (fast and shallow);\nlow oxygen saturation;\npleural effusion (transudate type);\ncyanosis (late sign);\nincreased heart rate.\nit is a common misconception and pure speculation that atelectasis causes fever. a study of 100 post-op patients followed with serial chest x-rays and temperature measurements showed that the incidence of fever decreased as the incidence of atelectasis increased. a recent review article summarizing the available published evidence on the association between atelectasis and post-op fever concluded that there is no clinical evidence supporting this speculation.\n== causes ==\nthe most common cause is post-surgical atelectasis, characterized by splinting, i.e. restricted breathing after abdominal surgery. atelectasis develops in 75-90% of people undergoing general anesthesia for a surgical procedure.\nanother common cause is pulmonary tuberculosis. smokers and the elderly are also at an increased risk. outside of this context, atelectasis implies some blockage of a bronchiole or bronchus, which can be within the airway (foreign body, mucus plug), from the wall (tumor, usually squamous cell carcinoma) or compressing from the outside (tumor, lymph node, tubercle). another cause is poor surfactant spreading during inspiration, causing the surface tension to be at its highest which tends to collapse smaller alveoli. atelectasis may also occur during suction, as along with sputum, air is withdrawn from the lungs. there are several types of atelectasis according to their underlying mechanisms or the distribution of alveolar collapse; resorption, compression, microatelectasis and contraction atelectasis. relaxation atelectasis (also called passive atelectasis) is when a pleural effusion or a pneumothorax disrupts the contact between the parietal and visceral pleurae.\nrisk factors associated with increased likelihood of the development of atelectasis include: type of surgery (thoracic, cardiopulmonary surgeries), use of muscle relaxation, obesity, high oxygen, the lower lung segments.\nfactors also associated with the development of atelectasis include: age, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and type of anesthetic.\nin the early 1950s, in uk aviation medicine, the condition acceleration atelectasis was given the name \"hunter lung\" due to its prevalence in pilots of the transonic fighter jet, the hawker hunter, which used a 100% oxygen supply.\n== diagnosis ==\nclinically significant atelectasis is generally visible on chest x-ray; findings can include lung opacification and\/or loss of lung volume. post-surgical atelectasis will be bibasal in pattern. chest ct or bronchoscopy may be necessary if the cause

{"id":"361b96b6633d357e0b99f6ad7bcf20b5","chunk":"prune belly syndrome is a rare, genetic birth defect affecting about 1 in 40,000 births. about 97% of those affected are male. prune belly syndrome is a congenital disorder of the urinary system, characterized by a triad of symptoms. the syndrome is named for the mass of wrinkled skin that is often (but not always) present on the abdomen of those with the disorder.\n== signs and symptoms ==\nprune-belly triad consists of signs such as:\na partial or complete lack of abdominal wall muscles. there may be wrinkly folds of skin covering the abdomen.\ncryptorchidism (undescended testicles) in males\nurinary tract abnormality such as unusually large ureters, distended bladder, accumulation and backflow of urine from the bladder to the ureters and the kidneys (vesicoureteral reflux)\nother signs include:\nfrequent urinary tract infections due to the inability to properly expel urine.\nventricular septal defect\nmalrotation of the gut\nclub foot\nlater in life, a common symptom is post-ejaculatory discomfort. most likely a bladder spasm, it lasts about two hours.\nmusculoskeletal abnormalities include pectus excavatum, scoliosis, and congenital joint dislocations including the hip. diagnosis of prune belly syndrome necessitates a thorough orthopaedic evaluation because of the high prevalence of associated musculoskeletal abnormalities.\npulmonary hypoplasia, pneumonia, and atelectasis involving lung lobes\n=== complications ===\nprune belly syndrome can result in distention and enlargement of internal organs such as the bladder and intestines. surgery is often required but will not return the organs to a normal size. bladder reductions have shown that the bladder will again stretch to its previous size due to lack of muscle. complications may also arise from enlarged\/malformed kidneys, which may result in kidney failure and the child's going on dialysis or requiring a kidney transplant. many individuals with prune belly syndrome have good physical and mental health, despite all the concerns. with proper treatment, however, a longer, healthier life is possible.\n== diagnosis ==\nprune belly syndrome can be diagnosed via ultrasound while a child is still in-utero. urinary tract dilation, bladder outlet obstruction, distended bladder wall and an abnormally large abdominal cavity with deficient abdominal wall musculature are key indicators, as the abdomen swells with the pressure of accumulated urine.\nin young children, frequent urinary tract infections often herald prune belly syndrome, as they are normally uncommon. if a problem is suspected, doctors can perform blood tests to check renal function. another study that may suggest the syndrome is a voiding cystourethrogram.\npbs is far more common in males. autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested in some cases. a homozygous mutation in the muscarinic cholinergic receptor-3 gene (chrm3) on chromosome 1q43 was reported in one family.\n== treatment ==\nthe type of treatment, like that of most disorders, depends on the severity of the symptoms. one option is to perform a vesicostomy, which allows the bladder to drain through a small hole in the abdomen, thus helping to prevent urinary tract infections. similarly, consistent self-catheterization, often several times per day, can be an effective approach to preventing infections. a more drastic procedure is a surgical \"remodeling\" of the abdominal wall and urinary tract. boys often need to undergo an orchiopexy to move the testes to their proper place in the scrotum.\n== references ==\n== external links ==\nthe journal of bone & joint surgery |

(lond.) in 1882. after postgraduate study at vienna clinics, he graduated md in 1884.\nhe then accepted a registrar's post at the middlesex hospital, which he continued to serve throughout his career as assistant physician, full physician and consulting physician, lecturer on forensic medicine, hygiene and medicine, and dean of the medical school. another lifelong association was with the queen's hospital for children, hackney, which elected him as its physician and consulting physician. a fluent speaker of french and german, he was also physician to the french hospital for some years.\nhe was elected frcp in 1891. he gave the bradshaw lecture in 1908. on 15 may 1911 he delivered his presidential address to the medical society of london on post-operative lung complications. during wwi he served from 1914 to 1918, at the rouen base with the temporary rank of colonel, army medical services, as consultant physician to the british armies in france. his predecessor in that post was james kingston fowler. for his military service, pasteur was mentioned in dispatches and was appointed cb in 1918 and cmg in 1919. wwi gave him many opportunities for studying gunshot wounds to the chest.\nthoracic disease was the main -- although not the only -- field of his private researches. his bradshaw lecture of 1908 discussed massive collapse of the lung after operation, a condition to which he referred again in an article in 1914 and one which, indeed, owed its discovery and description to pasteur.\nhe was a member of the athenaeum club and the alpine club.\n== family ==\nwilliam pasteur's parents emigrated from switzerland to england. in 1890 william pasteur married violet mabel seddon. they had two daughters and a son. their son, william raymond pasteur, was born in 1896. he became a captain in the british army, was killed in action on 10 july 1917 in west flanders, and was awarded the military cross.\n== atelectasis ==\natelectasis (at-uh-lek-tuh-sis) is a complete or partial collapse of the entire lung or area (lobe) of the lung. it occurs when the tiny air sacs (alveoli) within the lung become deflated or possibly filled with alveolar fluid. atelectasis is one of the most common breathing (respiratory) complications after surgery. it's also a possible complication of other respiratory problems, including cystic fibrosis, lung tumors, chest injuries, fluid in the lung and respiratory weakness. you may develop atelectasis if you breathe in a foreign object.\nthe term atelectasis pulmonum was introduced in 1832 by the physician eduard jorg (1808-1878), whose father was johann christian gottfried jorg (1779-1856), leipzig professor of medicine, specializing in obstetrics, gynecology, and pediatrics. clinical interest in atelectasis was stimulated by william pasteur's presentation in 1890.\n== selected publications ==\nwith solomon solis-cohen: \"spontaneous pneumothorax and pneumo-pericardium\". the american journal of the medical sciences. 103 (2). philadelphia: 193-194. february 1892.\n\"a case of myxoedema supervening on graves' disease\". transact. of the clin. soc. of london. 33: 189-192. 1900.\npasteur, w.

{"id":"ae52b777dc21fc4128490fba349cb65e","chunk":"streptococcal pharyngitis, also known as streptococcal sore throat (strep throat), is pharyngitis (an infection of the pharynx, the back of the throat) caused by streptococcus pyogenes, a gram-positive, group a streptococcus. common symptoms include fever, sore throat, red tonsils, and enlarged lymph nodes in the front of the neck. a headache and nausea or vomiting may also occur. some develop a sandpaper-like rash which is known as scarlet fever. symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.\nstrep throat is spread by respiratory droplets from an infected person, spread by talking, coughing or sneezing, or by touching something that has droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. as with all respiratory pathogens once presumed to transmit via respiratory droplets, it is highly likely to be carried by the aerosols generated during routine breathing, talking, and even singing. it may be spread directly through touching infected sores. it may also be spread by contact with skin infected with group a strep. the diagnosis is made based on the results of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture. some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms.\nprevention is with airborne precautions, frequent hand washing, and not sharing eating utensils. there is no vaccine for the disease. treatment with antibiotics is only recommended in those with a confirmed diagnosis. those infected should stay away from other people until fever is gone and for at least 12 hours after starting treatment. pain can be treated with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as ibuprofen.\nstrep throat is a common bacterial infection in children. it is the cause of 15-40% of sore throats among children and 5-15% among adults. cases are more common in late winter and early spring. potential complications include rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess.\n== signs and symptoms ==\nthe typical signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis are a sore throat, fever of greater than 38 degc (100 degf), tonsillar exudates (pus on the tonsils), and large cervical lymph nodes.\nother symptoms include: headache, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, muscle pain, or a scarlatiniform rash or palatal petechiae, the latter being an uncommon but highly specific finding.\nsymptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.\nstrep throat is unlikely when any of the symptoms of red eyes, hoarseness, runny nose, or mouth ulcers are present. it is also unlikely when there is no fever.\n== cause ==\nstrep throat is caused by group a b-hemolytic streptococcus (gas or s. pyogenes). humans are the primary natural reservoir for group a streptococcus. other bacteria such as non-group a b-hemolytic streptococci and fusobacterium may also cause pharyngitis. it is spread by direct, close contact with an infected person; thus crowding, as may be found in the military and schools, increases the rate of transmission. dried bacteria in dust are not infectious, although moist bacteria on toothbrushes or similar items can persist for up to fifteen days. contaminated food can result in outbreaks, but this is rare. of children with no signs or symptoms, 12% carry gas in their pharynx, and, after treatment, approximately 15% of those remain positive, and are true \"carriers\".\n== diagnosis ==\na number of scoring systems exist to help with diagnosis; however, their use is controversial due to insufficient accuracy. the modified centor criteria are a set of five criteria; the total score indicates the probability of a streptococcal infection.\none point is given for each of the criteria:\nabsence of a cough\nswollen and tender cervical lymph nodes\ntemperature >38.0 degc (100.4 degf)\ntonsillar exudate or swelling\nage less than 15 (a point is subtracted if age >44)\na score of one may indicate no treatment or culture is needed or

the major and minor pectoral muscles, trapezius muscles, and neck muscle; and internal structures such as the diaphragm, the esophagus, the trachea, and a part of the sternum known as the xiphoid process. arteries and veins are also contained - (aorta, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and the pulmonary artery); bones (the shoulder socket containing the upper part of the humerus, the scapula, sternum, thoracic portion of the spine, collarbone, and the rib cage and floating ribs).\nexternal structures are the skin and nipples.\n==== the chest ====\nin the human body, the region of the thorax between the neck and diaphragm in the front of the body is called the chest. the corresponding area in an animal can also be referred to as the chest.\nthe shape of the chest does not correspond to that part of the thoracic skeleton that encloses the heart and lungs. all the breadth of the shoulders is due to the shoulder girdle, and contains the axillae and the heads of the humeri. in the middle line the suprasternal notch is seen above, while about three fingers' breadth below it a transverse ridge can be felt, which is known as the sternal angle and this marks the junction between the manubrium and body of the sternum. level with this line the second ribs join the sternum, and when these are found the lower ribs can often be counted. at the lower part of the sternum, where the seventh or last true ribs join it, the ensiform cartilage begins, and above this there is often a depression known as the pit of the stomach.\n==== bones ====\nthe bones of the thorax, called the \"thoracic skeleton\" is a component of the axial skeleton.\nit consists of the ribs and sternum. the ribs of the thorax are numbered in ascending order from 1-12. 11 and 12 are known as floating ribs because they have no anterior attachment point in particular the cartilage attached to the sternum, as 1 through 7 are, and therefore are termed \"floating\". whereas ribs 8 through 10 are termed false ribs as their costal cartilage articulates with the costal cartilage of the rib above. the thorax bones also have the main function of protecting the heart, lungs, and major blood vessels in the thorax area, such as the aorta.\n==== anatomical landmarks ====\nthe anatomy of the chest can also be described through the use of anatomical landmarks. the nipple in the male is situated in front of the fourth rib or a little below; vertically it lies a little external to a line drawn down from the middle of the clavicle; in the female it is not so constant. a little below it the lower limit of the great pectoral muscle is seen running upward and outward to the axilla; in the female this is obscured by the breast, which extends from the second to the sixth rib vertically and from the edge of the sternum to the mid-axillary line laterally. the female nipple is surrounded for half an inch by a more","chunk_id":"98d774a3b9709b7966a7aa6905268d71","document_ids":["893caab4007f2a0b224b78c655349a08"],"n_tokens":912,"entities":[{"name":"\"THORAX\"","type":"\"DISEASE\"","description":"\"Thorax is a part of the anatomy located between the neck and the abdomen, containing organs like the heart, lungs, and thymus gland.\"","source_id":"98d774a3b9709b7966a7aa6905268d71"},{"name":"\"CHEST PAIN\"","type":"\"SYMPTOM\"","description":"\"Chest Pain is a common symptom associated with many diseases affecting the chest.\"","source_id":"98d774a3b9709b7966a7aa6905268d71"},{"name":"\"LUNGS\"","type":"\"ORGAN\"","description":"\"The lungs are a pair of organs responsible for respiration and gas exchange.\"","source_id":"98d774a3b9709b7966a7aa6905268d71"},{"name":"\"THYMUS GLAND\"","type":"\"ORGAN\"","description":"\"The thymus gland is a lymphoid organ located in the upper chest responsible for T-cell maturation.\"","source_id":"98d774a3b9709b7966a7aa6905268d71"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d5\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d4\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d3\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"weight\" attr.type=\"double\" \/>  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;THORAX&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"DISEASE\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Thorax is a part of the anatomy located between the neck and the abdomen, containing organs like the heart, lungs, and thymus gland.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">98d774a3b9709b7966a7aa6905268d71<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;CHEST PAIN&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"SYMPTOM\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Chest Pain is a common symptom associated with many diseases affecting the chest.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">98d774a3b9709b7966a7aa6905268d71<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;LUNGS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGAN\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The lungs are a pair of organs responsible for respiration and gas exchange.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">98d774a3b9709b7966a7aa6905268d71<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;THYMUS GLAND&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGAN\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The thymus gland is a lymphoid organ located in the upper chest responsible for T-cell maturation.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">98d774a3b9709b7966a7aa6905268d71<\/data>    <\/node>    <edge source=\"&quot;THORAX&quot;\" target=\"&quot;CHEST PAIN&quot;\">      <data key=\"d3\">2.0<\/data>      <data key=\"d4\">\"Chest pain is a symptom experienced as a result of diseases affecting the thorax.\"\"The thorax can be affected by diseases causing chest pain.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d5\">98d774a3b9709b7966a7aa6905268d71<\/data>    <\/edge>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

or sinusitis in a hypoplastic sinus 4. however, manometric measurement in a number of cases have confirmed the presence of negative pressures, as well as proof of normal-sized sinuses on previous imaging 3 - these make the latter two hypotheses unlikely.radiographic featuresalthough the diagnosis is usually made clinically, usually by otolaryngologists and ophthalmologists, imaging of the sinuses confirms the findings. additionally, the diagnosis may be made incidentally on imaging of the region for other reasons.plain radiographplain radiographs are no longer considered sufficiently sensitive or specific for the assessment of paranasal sinus disease. however, they are still not infrequently performed. the findings are the same as those seen on ct (see below).ctct, preferably performed as a volumetric acquisition with three-plane orthogonal reformats, is able to elegantly demonstrate changes in the sinus and the adjacent structures.the sinus is fully formed but fully opacified and reduced in volume with inward bowing of all four walls. this manifests as 1:\ninferior bowing of the roof (orbital floor): increased orbital volume and enophthalmos\nlateral bowing of the medial wall: lateral displacement of the middle and inferior turbinate\nposterior bowing of the anterior wall: flattening of the malar eminence\nanteromedial bowing of the posterolateral wall\nthe uncinate process is usually superiorly and laterally displaced, in direct contact with the inferomedial wall of the orbit, and the ostiomeatal complex is occluded 1.mrimri is not required for the diagnosis. if it is performed, it will demonstrate (in addition to the anatomical changes above) a fully opacified sinus with thickening and enhancement of the mucosa. the secretions are of variable intensity.treatment and prognosisthe condition is benign","chunk_id":"58216d874d3023b49d760d348f992b19","document_ids":["9383240fefdfb81606a1151d99b599d7"],"n_tokens":1200,"entities":[{"name":"\"SILENT SINUS SYNDROME\"","type":"\"DISEASE\"","description":"\"Silent Sinus Syndrome represents maxillary sinus atelectasis that results in painless enophthalmos, hypoglobus, and facial asymmetry.

{"id":"2591ff20a9b26d87698e858a66fa6192","chunk":"oxygen therapy, also referred to as supplemental oxygen, is the use of oxygen as medical treatment. supplemental oxygen can also refer to the use of oxygen enriched air at altitude. acute indications for therapy include hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels), carbon monoxide toxicity and cluster headache. it may also be prophylactically given to maintain blood oxygen levels during the induction of anesthesia. oxygen therapy is often useful in chronic hypoxemia caused by conditions such as severe copd or cystic fibrosis. oxygen can be delivered via nasal cannula, face mask, or endotracheal intubation at normal atmospheric pressure, or in a hyperbaric chamber. it can also be given through bypassing the airway, such as in ecmo therapy.\noxygen is required for normal cellular metabolism. however, excessively high concentrations can result in oxygen toxicity, leading to lung damage and respiratory failure. higher oxygen concentrations can also increase the risk of airway fires, particularly while smoking. oxygen therapy can also dry out the nasal mucosa without humidification. in most conditions, an oxygen saturation of 94-96% is adequate, while in those at risk of carbon dioxide retention, saturations of 88-92% are preferred. in cases of carbon monoxide toxicity or cardiac arrest, saturations should be as high as possible. while air is typically 21% oxygen by volume, oxygen therapy can increase o2 content of air up to 100%.\nthe medical use of oxygen first became common around 1917, and is the most common hospital treatment in the developed world. it is currently on the world health organization's list of essential medicines. home oxygen can be provided either by oxygen tanks or oxygen concentrator.\n== medical uses ==\noxygen is widely used by hospitals, ems, and first-aid providers in a variety of conditions and settings. a few indications frequently requiring high-flow oxygen include resuscitation, major trauma, anaphylaxis, major bleeding, shock, active convulsions, and hypothermia.\n=== acute conditions ===\nin context of acute hypoxemia, oxygen therapy should be titrated to a target level based on pulse oximetry (94-96% in most patients, or 88-92% in people with copd). this can be performed by increasing oxygen delivery, described as fio2(fraction of inspired oxygen). in 2018, the british medical journal recommended that oxygen therapy be stopped for saturations greater than 96% and not started for saturations above 90 to 93%. this may be due to an association between excessive oxygenation in the acutely ill and increased mortality. exceptions to these recommendations include carbon monoxide poisoning, cluster headaches, sickle cell crisis, and pneumothorax.\noxygen therapy has also been used as emergency treatment for decompression sickness for years. recompression in a hyperbaric chamber with 100% oxygen is the standard treatment for decompression illness. the success of recompression therapy is greatest if given within four hours after resurfacing, with earlier treatment associated with a decreased number of recompression treatments required for resolution. it has been suggested in literature that heliox may be a better alternative to oxygen therapy.\nin the context of stroke, oxygen therapy may be beneficial as long as hyperoxic environments are avoided.\npeople receiving outpatient oxygen therapy for hypoxemia following acute illness or hospitalization should be re-assessed by a physician prior to prescription renewal to gauge the necessity of ongoing oxygen therapy. if the initial hypoxemia has resolved, additional treatment may be an unnecessary use of resources.\n=== chronic conditions ===\ncommon conditions which may require a baseline of supplementary oxygen include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. patients may also require additional oxygen during acute exacerbations. oxygen may also be prescribed for breathlessness, end-stage cardiac failure, respiratory failure, advance","chunk_id":"2591ff20a9b26d87698e858a66fa6192","document_ids":["9621dd4e5f8930a7e0d0b8fb80c1b695"],"n_tokens":794,"entities":[{"name":"\"OXYGEN THERAPY\"","type":"\"DISEASE\/SYMPTOM\"","description":"\"Oxygen Therapy is the medical treatment involving the use of oxygen.

{"id":"5a08ca2f0af19fb355e030719cf7894e","chunk":"ventilator-associated lung injury (vali) is an acute lung injury that develops during mechanical ventilation and is termed ventilator-induced lung injury (vili) if it can be proven that the mechanical ventilation caused the acute lung injury. in contrast, ventilator-associated lung injury (vali) exists if the cause cannot be proven. vali is the appropriate term in most situations because it is virtually impossible to prove what actually caused the lung injury in the hospital.\n== cause ==\nit is generally regarded, based on animal models and human studies, that volutrauma is the most harmful aspect of mechanical ventilation. this may be regarded as the over-stretching of the airways and alveoli.\nduring mechanical ventilation, the flow of gas into the lung will take the path of least resistance. areas of the lung that are collapsed (atelectasis) or filled with secretions will be underinflated, while those areas that are relatively normal will be overinflated. these areas will become overdistended and injured. this may be reduced by using smaller tidal volumes.\nduring positive pressure ventilation, atelectatic regions will inflate, however, the alveoli will be unstable and will collapse during the expiratory phase of the breath (atelectotrauma). this repeated alveolar collapse and expansion (race) is thought to cause vali. by opening the lung and keeping the lung open race (and vali) is reduced.\nanother possible ventilator-associated lung injury is known as biotrauma. biotrauma involves the lung suffering injury from any mediators of the inflammatory response or from bacteremia.\nfinally oxygen toxicity contributes to ventilator-associated lung injury through several mechanisms including oxidative stress.\npossible reasons for predisposition to vali include:\nan injured lung may be at risk for further injury\ncyclic atelectasis is particularly common in an injured lung\n== pathogenesis ==\noverdistension of alveoli and cyclic atelectasis (atelectotrauma) are the primary causes for alveolar injury during positive pressure mechanical ventilation. severe injury to alveoli causes swelling of the tissues (edema) in the lungs, bleeding of the alveoli, loss of surfactant (decrease in lung compliance) and complete alveoli collapse (biotrauma). high flow rates are associated with rheotrauma, high volumes with volutrauma and pressures with barotrauma. collectively these may be converted into a single unit of mechanical power.\n== diagnosis ==\nvali does not need to be distinguished from progressive ali\/ards because management is the same in both. additionally, definitive diagnosis of vali may not be possible because of lack of sign or symptoms.\n== prevention ==\n=== preventing alveolar overdistension ===\nalveolar overdistension is mitigated by using small tidal volumes, maintaining a low plateau pressure, and most effectively by using volume-limited ventilation. a 2018 systematic review by the cochrane collaboration provided evidence that low tidal volume ventilation reduced post operative pneumonia and reduced the requirement for both invasive and non invasive ventilation after surgery\n=== preventing cyclic atelectasis (atelectotrauma) ===\napplied positive end-expiratory pressure (peep) is the principal method used to keep the alveoli open and lessen cyclic atelectasis.\n=== open lung ventilation ===\nopen lung ventilation is a ventilatory strategy that combines small tidal volumes (to lessen alveolar overdistension) and an applied peep above the low inflection point on the pressure-volume curve (to lessen cyclic atelectasis).\nhigh frequency ventilation is thought to reduce ventilator-associated lung injury, especially in the context of ards and acute lung injury.\npermissive hypercapnia and hypoxaemia allow the patient to be ventilated at less aggressive settings and can, therefore, mitigate all forms of ventilator-associated lung injury\n== epidemiology ==\nvali is most common in people receiving mechanical ventilation for acute

{"id":"e0f2b3bc85b14d4d6cb492642e382aaa","chunk":"mediastinal shift is an abnormal movement of the mediastinal structures toward one side of the chest cavity. a shift indicates a severe imbalance of pressures inside the chest. mediastinal shifts are generally caused by increased lung volume, decreased lung volume, or abnormalities in the pleural space. additionally, masses inside the mediastinum or musculoskeletal abnormalities can also lead to abnormal mediastinal arrangement. typically, these shifts are observed on x-ray but also on computed tomography (ct) or magnetic resonance imaging (mri). on chest x-ray, tracheal deviation, or movement of the trachea away from its midline position can be used as a sign of a shift. other structures, like the heart, can also be used as reference points. below are examples of pathologies that can cause a mediastinal shift and their appearance.\n== pleural space abnormalities ==\n=== tension pneumothorax ===\ntension pneumothorax is an emergent condition in which air gets trapped in the space between the chest wall and the lung. this space is referred to as the pleural space. because air can't escape from this space, the air pocket grows larger and larger, resulting in the lung collapse closest to the pneumothorax. forces are transmitted to the mediastinum and effectively \"push\" the mediastinal structures to the opposite side of the chest.\n=== pleural effusion ===\na pleural effusion is an accumulation of fluid inside the pleural space. if this collection of fluid gets large enough, it can also push structures in the chest away from it and cause a mediastinal shift. however, a pleural effusion can also pull the mediastinal structure towards itself. if this is the case, then there is an underlying condition causing the collapse of the lung on that side. an example is a tumor obstructing a bronchus and causing lung collapse and pleural effusion.\n=== hemothorax ===\nhemothorax, or accumulation of blood in the pleural space, can result from trauma or surgical procedures in the chest. this accumulation of blood can grow large enough to compress the lung and push away other structures in the chest, thus causing a mediastinal shift. on a chest x-ray, a hemothorax can appear similarly to a pleural effusion with blunting of the pleural recess and white out of normal lung zones. in the setting of traumatic chest injury, rib fractures are also commonly observed on x-ray.\n=== empyema ===\nan empyema is a collection of pus inside the pleural cavity. it is a complication of pneumonia or thoracic injury or surgery and also requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. radiographic appearance is similar to that of a pleural effusion with costophrenic angle blunting and white out of lung zones. ct imaging is necessary to evaluate the structure of the empyema and evaluate for loculation or separation of the pus into different compartments. finally, ultrasound is becoming a more commonly used imaging technique to evaluate an empyema. ultrasound is more readily available at the bedside, is better at detecting pleural effusion, and can be used to guide thoracentesis to remove the empyema.\n=== masses ===\nmasses such as tumors can also cause compression and displacement of mediastinal structures. there are various mediastinal tumors, and they are classified by their location in the chest. notable examples include germ cell tumors and lymphomas. teratomas are a class of germ cell tumors that arise in the chest due to failure of germ cell migration during development. they can expand to large sizes and cause hemoptysis and pleural effusion. radiographic features of teratomas typically include fluid and fat but also muscle, teeth, and bones inside the mass.\n== decreased lung volume ==\n=== atelectasis ===\natelectasis is the partial collapse of a lung that is reversible. there are numerous etiologies, including post-operative atelectasis, surfactant deficiency, mucus plugging, and foreign body aspiration. notably, post-operative atelectasis is thought

obstructive atelectasis is a form of lung collapse that is due to obstruction of the airways supplying a lung segment or lobe. it is a term used to distinguish atelectasis identified on imaging based on the underlying pathophysiology to guide diagnosis.\non this page:\narticle:\nclinical presentation\npathology\nradiographic features\nrelated articles\nreferences\nimages:cases and figures\nclinical presentationthe presentation of patients with atelectasis depends on the underlying cause. however, breathlessness is common if there is significant lung collapse and infective symptoms can be present if there is co-existing sepsis.pathologyas the name implies, in this form of atelectasis there is partial or complete bronchial obstruction which leads to poor ventilation of the airways supplied. as ventilation between the distal airspaces and the trachea is disrupted the residual air in the affected lung is resorbed by the circulating blood at a rate greater than it is replaced by fresh ventilated air. this causes volume loss in the affected lung. volume loss may be minimal in distal airways obstruction due to the presence of collateral ventilation via the pores of kohn.the rate at which atelectasis progresses depends on whether there is obstruction of a lobar or segmental bronchus. lobar obstruction manifests as lobar atelectasis. in segmental atelectasis, there is often a degree of collateral ventilation from adjacent lung segments which causes a slightly distinct radiographic presentation. the speed of collapse is quicker if the patient is being given 100% oxygen 3.collapse occurs quickly if the obstruction is due to a luminal lesion that can act as a one-way valve.eventually, there can be sequestration of local lung secretions over time and areas of significant atelectasis are prone to become infected. hence, this type of collapse is frequently seen with co-existing consolidation.aetiologythe causes of resorption (obstructive) atelectasis can be thought of in terms of where the obstructing lesion is arising from with respect to the bronchial lumen:\nextraluminal\nneoplasm\nlymphadenopathy\nbronchial\nfibrotic stricture\nneoplasm\nspontaneous rupture 4\nluminal\nmucus plugging\nasthma\npneumonia\npostoperative\npost anaesthetic\npusbacterial pneumonia\nbloodpost-traumatic lung injury\nforeign body\nendobronchial intubation\nadvertisement: supporters see fewer\/no ads\nradiographic featuresplain radiograph \/ ctthe imaging features of atelectasis are similar on plain radiographs and ct with more detail being available on the ct:\nincreased density at the site of atelectasis\nloss of normal thoracic silhouettes (silhouette sign)\ndisplacement of the fissures toward the area of atelectasis\nupward displacement of ipsilateral hemidiaphragm\ncrowding of pulmonary vessels and bronchi affected area\ncompensatory hyperinflation of the unaffected lung\nmediastinal shift\nipsilateral tracheal deviation\nipsilateral shift of the heart\nif volume loss is minimal and there is consolidation present, then the term drowned lung can be used to indicate transudate replacing the air in the collapsing lung. the transudate is rapidly cleared when the obstruction is removed, as is commonly seen in postoperative patients with mucus plugging.ultrasoundas a consequence of the cessation of ventilation, lung sliding is immediately abolished. in contrast to a pneumothorax, another cause of absent lung sliding, the presence of a lung pulse implies that the visceral and parietal pleura are still in apposition. as alveolar gas is absorbed, the lung parenchyma may assume a tissue-like echogenicity, with the following internal features 9:\nair

{"id":"fccf2671b203b97c7d4c28dcb2b92413","chunk":"a pulmonary alveolus (pl.: alveoli, from latin alveolus, \"little cavity\"), also known as an air sac or air space, is one of millions of hollow, distensible cup-shaped cavities in the lungs where pulmonary gas exchange takes place. oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide at the blood-air barrier between the alveolar air and the pulmonary capillary. alveoli make up the functional tissue of the mammalian lungs known as the lung parenchyma, which takes up 90 percent of the total lung volume.\nalveoli are first located in the respiratory bronchioles that mark the beginning of the respiratory zone. they are located sparsely in these bronchioles, line the walls of the alveolar ducts, and are more numerous in the blind-ended alveolar sacs. the acini are the basic units of respiration, with gas exchange taking place in all the alveoli present. the alveolar membrane is the gas exchange surface, surrounded by a network of capillaries. oxygen is diffused across the membrane into the capillaries and carbon dioxide is released from the capillaries into the alveoli to be breathed out.\nalveoli are particular to mammalian lungs. different structures are involved in gas exchange in other vertebrates.\n== structure ==\nthe alveoli are first located in the respiratory bronchioles as scattered outpockets, extending from their lumens. the respiratory bronchioles run for considerable lengths and become increasingly alveolated with side branches of alveolar ducts that become deeply lined with alveoli. the ducts number between two and eleven from each bronchiole. each duct opens into five or six alveolar sacs into which clusters of alveoli open.\neach terminal respiratory unit is called an acinus and consists of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. new alveoli continue to form until the age of eight years.\na typical pair of human lungs contains about 480 million alveoli, providing a total surface area for gas exchange of between 70 and 80 square metres. each alveolus is wrapped in a fine mesh of capillaries covering about 70% of its area. the diameter of an alveolus is between 200 and 500 mm.\n=== microanatomy ===\nan alveolus consists of an epithelial layer of simple squamous epithelium (very thin, flattened cells), and an extracellular matrix surrounded by capillaries. the epithelial lining is part of the alveolar membrane, also known as the respiratory membrane, that allows the exchange of gases. the membrane has several layers - a layer of alveolar lining fluid that contains surfactant, the epithelial layer and its basement membrane; a thin interstitial space between the epithelial lining and the capillary membrane; a capillary basement membrane that often fuses with the alveolar basement membrane, and the capillary endothelial membrane. the whole membrane however is only between 0.2 mm at its thinnest part and 0.6 mm at its thickest.\nin the alveolar walls there are interconnecting air passages between the alveoli known as the pores of kohn. the alveolar septum that separates the alveoli in the alveolar sac contains some collagen fibers and elastic fibers. the septa also house the enmeshed capillary network that surrounds each alveolus. the elastic fibres allow the alveoli to stretch when they fill with air during inhalation. they then spring back during exhalation in order to expel the carbon dioxide-rich air.\nthere are three major types of alveolar cell. two types are pneumocytes or pneumonocytes known as type i and type ii cells found in the alveolar wall, and a large phagocytic cell known as an alveolar macrophage that moves about in the lumens of the alveoli, and in the connective tissue between them. type i cells, also called type i pneumocytes, or type i alveolar cells, are squamous, thin and flat and form the structure of the alveoli. type ii cells, also called type ii pneumocytes or type ii alveolar cells, release pulmonary surfactant to lower surface tension, and can also differentiate to replace

{"id":"696ca949f87d9e80768754eb0eb4bafe","chunk":"pulmonary hygiene, also referred to as pulmonary toilet, is a set of methods used to clear mucus and secretions from the airways. the word pulmonary refers to the lungs. the word toilet, related to the french toilette, refers to body care and hygiene; this root is used in words such as toiletry that also relate to cleansing.\nrespiratory health (pulmonary hygiene) depends on consistent clearance of airway secretions. normal airway clearance is accomplished by two important mechanisms: the mucociliary clearance system and the ability to cough. impaired mucociliary clearance is linked to poor lung function in a broad range of diseases and disabilities.\npulmonary hygiene prevents atelectasis (the collapse of the alveoli of the lungs) and rids the respiratory system of secretions, which could cause respiratory infections. it can also decrease pulmonary shunting, increase the functional reserve capacity of the lungs, and prevent respiratory infection after chest trauma. methods include using suction to remove fluids and placing the patient in a position that allows secretions to drain by gravity.\n== methods ==\nmethods used for pulmonary hygiene include suctioning of the airways, chest physiotherapy, blow bottles, and nasotracheal suction. bronchoscopy, in which a tube is inserted into the airways so that an examiner can view them, can be used therapeutically as part of pulmonary hygiene. incentive spirometry and use of analgesics (pain medications) that do not inhibit breathing are also parts of pulmonary toilet. coughing is also important for ridding the airways of secretions, so healthcare providers are careful not to oversedate patients, because that could inhibit coughing. tracheotomy facilitates pulmonary toilet. percussion, another method, loosens secretions and allows the cilia of the airways to remove material. positioning is another method for promoting drainage of secretions; sometimes patients are placed in a prone position to aid in this purpose.\n=== conventional chest physiotherapy ===\nthe most common treatment of atelectasis in the hospital setting is manual chest physiotherapy though there is limited evidence of its efficacy. chest percussion and postural drainage are used in bronchiectasis and lung abscess. the patient's body is positioned so that the trachea is inclined downward and below the affected chest area. postural drainage is essential in treating bronchiectasis. patients must receive physiotherapy to learn to tip themselves into a position in which the lobe to be drained is uppermost at least three times daily for up to 30 minutes during each session.\nthe treatment is often used in conjunction with a technique for loosening secretions in the chest cavity called chest percussion. chest percussion is performed by clapping the back or chest with a cupped hand. alternatively, a mechanical vibrator may be used in some cases to facilitate loosening of secretions. there are drainage positions for all segments of the lung. these positions are modified depending on the patient's condition and the location of the area in most need of therapy.\n=== intermittent positive pressure breathing (physiotherapy) ===\nintermittent positive pressure breathing (ippb) physiotherapy has long been used in the intensive care setting in non-intubated patients. although widely accepted, few studies have validated its efficacy. in a respiratory care clinical practice guideline, ippb is suggested for patients who have impaired airway clearance, and for delivery of aerosolized medications to patients with neuromuscular weakness who are incapable of inhaling deeply. ippb physiotherapy should be used with caution in patients with severe, uncontrolled bronchospasm or severe airway obstruction\n=== mechanical insufflation-exsufflation physiotherapy ===\npeople with neuromuscular weakness and atelectasis benefit from mechanical insufflation-exsufflation. mechanically-assisted coughing greatly improves secretion clearance in

{"id":"80c443461454a5d23adbd38f9a217f55","chunk":"postoperative fever refers to an elevated body temperature (>= 38.5 degc) occurring after a recent surgical procedure. diagnosing the cause of postoperative fever can sometimes be challenging; while fever in this context may be benign, self-limited, or unrelated to the surgical procedure, it can also be indicative of a surgical complication, such as infection.\n== causes ==\nthe most common causes of postoperative fever are often summarized for medical students by a mnemonic beginning with the letter w. the classic list consists of five w's - wind, water, wound, walking, and wonder drugs, but two other causes should also be considered - wing\/waterway and (w)abscess. there is a characteristic timeframe after surgery when many of these complications tend to develop (postoperative days or pod).\nother important causes of early post-operative fever that are omitted from this list include malignant hyperthermia, a potentially life-threatening but treatable response to inhalational anesthetic and paralytic agents.\nearly postoperative fever (i.e., within the first 48 hours post-operatively) has often been ascribed to atelectasis, or splinting, but it is most likely part of a natural and non-infectious inflammatory response (with sympathetic nervous system involvement) to the tissue injury sustained during surgery; it generally requires no medical intervention except antipyretics and extra fluid intake.\n== workup ==\nthe diagnostic workup of post-operative fever is guided by the potential etiologies on the differential diagnosis. the patient's surgical and post-operative course should be reviewed in detail, noting whether the patient has been regularly using an incentive spirometer or not, whether a foley catheter was\/is in place, what medications s\/he has received, etc. the patient should be asked if s\/he is having any pain (and where?) or other symptoms such as coughing or dysuria, which may help to localize the source of the fever. a thorough physical exam should be conducted, auscultating the lungs, noting erythema or drainage from the surgical incision(s), evaluating iv sites, noting lower extremity edema, etc.\nlaboratory testing and imaging is generally deferred for evaluation of fever that occurs within the first 48 hours post-operatively, unless prompted by specific findings in the history and physical exam. beyond 48 hours, testing routinely includes urine and blood cultures as well as a chest x-ray.\n== popular culture ==\nin the pilot episode of the medical drama grey's anatomy, meredith grey refers to this mnemonic: \"wind, water, wound, walking, wonder drugs. the 5 ws. most of the time it's wind; splinting or pneumonia. pneumonia is easy to assume. especially if you're too busy to do the tests.\"\n== see also ==\npatient safety\nperioperative mortality\n== references

{"id":"a494db57e09151400f4bf1b47e1fb0e2","chunk":"tympanic membrane retraction describes a condition in which a part of the eardrum lies deeper within the ear than its normal position.\nthe eardrum comprises two parts: the pars tensa, which is the main part of the eardrum, and the pars flaccida, which is a smaller part of the eardrum located above the pars tensa. either or both of these parts may become retracted. the retracted segment of eardrum is often known as a retraction pocket. the terms atelectasis or sometimes adhesive otitis media can be used to describe retraction of a large area of the pars tensa.\ntympanic membrane retraction is fairly common and has been observed in one quarter of a population of british school children. retraction of both eardrums is less common than having a retraction in just one ear. it is more common in children with cleft palate. tympanic membrane retraction also occurs in adults.\nattempts have been made to categorise the extent of tympanic membrane retraction though the validity of these classifications is limited.\n== presentation ==\nthe majority of tympanic membrane retractions do not cause any symptoms. some cause hearing loss by restricting sound-induced vibrations of the eardrum. permanent conductive hearing loss can be caused by erosion of the ossicles (hearing bones). discharge from the ear often indicates that the retraction pocket has developed into a cholesteatoma.\n== pathogenesis ==\nthree factors must occur for the tympanic membrane to become retracted:\n=== negative middle ear pressure ===\nwhen gas pressure within the middle ear is less than atmospheric pressure, the eardrum can become sucked into the middle ear space. this may be caused by disrupted gas exchange in the middle ear mucosa, inadequate opening of the eustachian tube or a combination of these factors. people with a patulous eustachian tube may also cause negative middle ear pressure by repeatedly sniffing to try to keep their eustachian tube closed.\n=== weakness of the tympanic membrane ===\nthe middle layer of the pars tensa is strengthened by fibers of collagen protein. this layer may be weaker in the postero-superior quadrant (top rear quarter) or after the eardrum heals after perforation or tympanostomy tubes (grommets) so predispose to retraction in these areas. the pars flaccida is prone to retraction as it does not contain the same stiffening layer of collagen.\n=== increase in surface area of the tympanic membrane ===\nall over the body, new skin cells are continually produced to replace old skin cells which dry out and slough off. growth of new cells on the surface of the eardrum is unusual in that the new cells migrate over the surface and move out along the ear canal. even if migration along the ear canal is blocked, new cells continue to grow so the surface of the eardrum becomes larger. this process of proliferation and migration can result in enlargement of a retraction pocket so that the eardrum expands and grows deeper into the ear.\n== natural history ==\nthe majority of tympanic membrane retractions remain stable for long periods of time, or may even resolve spontaneously so that the eardrum becomes normal again. not all retractions are able to resolve even if middle ear pressure normalizes, as the retracted segment may become adherent to other structures within the middle ear. some retractions continue to progress and grow more deeply into the ear. this can result in erosion of bone and cholesteatoma formation. asymptomatic deep pars tensa retractions tend to remain stable in adults. however, behaviour of symptomatic pars tensa retractions significantly differ between children and adults. there is a likelihood that such ears in children will recover spontaneously. there is no simple clinical means of identifying which ears will deteriorate to accumulate keratin debris in the pars tensa retraction, a phenomenon that is not influenced by age. in children, the pars tensa retraction may remain unchanged while the pars flaccida deteriorate","chunk_id":"a494db57e09151400f4bf1b47e1fb0e2","document_ids":["e05728d9b7c5d7e5f327a97abee000f9"],"n_tokens":828,"entities":[{"name":"\"TYMPANIC MEMBRANE

{"id":"1bb585c696488fdc0a8cc2fb7d2022bc","chunk":"silent sinus syndrome is a spontaneous, asymptomatic collapse of an air sinus (usually the maxillary sinus and orbital floor) associated with negative sinus pressures. it can cause painless facial asymmetry, diplopia and enophthalmos. diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms, and can be confirmed using a ct scan. treatment is surgical involving making an outlet for mucous drainage from the obstructed sinus, and, in some cases, paired with reconstruction of the orbital floor. it is slightly more common in middle age.\n== signs and symptoms ==\nsilent sinus syndrome can cause facial asymmetry (usually without pain), and vision problems (such as diplopia and enophthalmos). it may also cause headaches, and a feeling of fullness in the nose.\n== mechanism ==\nsilent sinus syndrome most often affects the maxillary sinus, usually with a collapse of the orbital floor. it may also affect the frontal sinus or the ethmoid sinus. when the maxillary sinus is involved, the inferior oblique muscle may be damaged.\nthe cause of silent sinus syndrome is not well understood. bacteria in the maxillary sinus may be involved. the connection to the nose may be blocked. this can create negative pressure in the sinus, as secretions are reabsorbed.\nrisk factors for silent sinus syndrome include any anatomic condition causing obstruction of the maxillary ostium, such as ipsilateral nasal septum deviation,ipsilateral laterally deviated middle turbinate, and narrowed infundibulum.\n== diagnosis ==\nsilent sinus syndrome is first suspected based on symptoms. a ct scan can be used to confirm a diagnosis. this can have characteristic features, including maxillary sinus outlet obstruction, sinus opacification, and sinus volume loss caused by inward retraction of the sinus walls.\n=== differential diagnosis ===\nsilent sinus syndrome is a subtype of stage three chronic maxillary atelectasis. the distinguishing factor is that in silent sinus syndrome, there is an absence of sinusitis symptoms. to be clear, chronic maxillary sinusitis may be a primary causitive factor in a significant number of silent sinus syndrome cases, it just may be asymptomatic. silent sinus syndrome also must be distinguished from maxillary sinus hypoplasia, which is congenital.\n== treatment ==\nsilent sinus syndrome is usually treated with surgery. the first stage involves restoring sinus function, most often by performing an endoscopic uncinectomy (removal of uncinate process) and maxillary antrostomy. the second stage, if needed, involves reconstruction of the orbital floor. while some clinics perform the two stages simultaneously, most authorities recommend waiting a minimum of 6 or as many as 18 months, as spontaneous remodeling of the orbital floor after the sinus repair will occur in many if not most cases. any prolapsed contents (such as those from the orbit) must be put back in place, though this is an rare occurrence in an already rare syndrome. if the inferior oblique muscle is damaged, it may be partially removed (known as myectomy). mucus and secretions must be drained from the sinus. earlier treatment has better outcomes.\n== epidemiology ==\nsilent sinus syndrome is fairly rare. it can occur at any age, but is slightly more common in middle-aged people. it occurs equally in sinuses on each side of the face.\n== history ==\nsilent sinus syndrome was first described in 1964.\n== references ==\n=== bibliography ===\nillner a, davidson hc, harnsberger hr, hoffman j (2002). \"the silent sinus syndrome:

collapse, but some authors reserve the term \"atelectasis\" for partial collapse, not inclusive of total atelectasis of the affected part of the lung or whole lung collapse.pathologyatelectasis is a radiopathological sign that can be categorised in many ways. each approach aims to help identify possible underlying causes together with other accompanying radiological and clinical findings.atelectasis can be subcategorised based on the underlying mechanism, as follows:\nresorptive (obstructive) atelectasis\noccurs as a result of complete obstruction of an airway\nno new air can enter the portion of the lung distal to the obstruction, and any air that is already there is eventually absorbed into the pulmonary capillary system, leaving a collapsed section of the affected lung\nbecause the visceral and parietal pleura do not separate in resorptive atelectasis, traction is created, and if the loss of volume is considerable, mobile thoracic structures may be pulled toward the side of volume loss (\"mediastinal shift\")\npotential causes of resorptive atelectasis include obstructing neoplasms, mucus plugging in asthmatics or critically ill patients and foreign body aspiration\nresorptive atelectasis of an entire lung (\"collapsed lung\") can result from complete obstruction of the right or left main bronchus\npassive (relaxation) atelectasis\noccurs when contact between the parietal and visceral pleura is disrupted with loss of normal negative pressure and the lung relaxes due to natural elastic recoil\nthe three most common specific aetiologies of passive atelectasis are pleural effusion, pneumothorax and diaphragmatic abnormality\ncompressive atelectasis\noccurs as a result of any thoracic space-occupying lesion (e.g. large pneumothorax) compressing the lung and forcing air out of the alveoli\ncicatrisation atelectasis\noccurs as a result of scarring or fibrosis that reduces lung expansion\ncommon aetiologies include granulomatous disease, necrotising pneumonia and radiation fibrosis\nadhesive atelectasis\noccurs from surfactant deficiency 2\ndepending on aetiology, this deficiency may either be diffuse throughout the lungs or localised\ngravity dependant atelectasis (dependent atelectasis)\nin the most dependent portions of the lungs due to the weight of the lungs\nosteophyte-induced adjacent pulmonary atelectasis and fibrosis\natelectasis can also be subcategorised by morphology:\nlinear (a.k.a. plate, band, discoid) atelectasis: a minimal degree of collapse as seen in patients who are not taking deep breaths (\"splinting\"), such as postoperative patients or patients with rib fracture or pleuritic chest pain; this is very common\nround atelectasis: classically associated with asbestos exposure\nlastly atelectasis can be described according to anatomical extent:\nlung atelectasis: complete collapse of one lung\nlobar atelectasis: collapse of one or more lobes of a lung.\nsegmental atelectasis: collapse of one or more individual pulmonary segments\nsubsegmental atelectasis: collapse of a portion of a pulmonary segment\nadvertisement: supporters see fewer\/no

alveolar volume and increased perfusion. due to gravity, it usually has a dependent and subpleural distribution. it is very commonly seen in the posterior lung bases on ct, particularly in elderly individuals.in normal lung, gravity gradients exist in end-inspiration between the apex and lung base of 4:1 in the erect patient and between the anterior and posterior lung of 2.5:1 in the supine patient 1. these gradients increase in the presence of lung disease that increases the weight of the lung causing atelectasis.pathologyaetiology\nbedridden patients\npatients with prolonged shallow
