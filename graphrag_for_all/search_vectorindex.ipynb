      "Question: What are symptoms of atelectasis? \n",
      "Context: atelectasis is the partial collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. it is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. it is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume, as distinct from pulmonary consolidation, in which they are filled with liquid. it is often referred to informally as a collapsed lung, although more accurately it usually involves only a partial collapse, and that ambiguous term is also informally used for a fully collapsed lung caused by a pneumothorax.\n",
      "it is a very common finding in chest x-rays and other radiological studies, and may be caused by normal exhalation or by various medical conditions. although frequently described as a collapse of lung tissue, atelectasis is not synonymous with a pneumothorax, which is a more specific condition that can cause atelectasis. acute atelectasis may occur as a post-operative complication or as a result of surfactant deficiency. in premature babies, this leads to infant respiratory distress syndrome.\n",
      "the term uses combining forms of atel- + ectasis, from greek: ateles, \"incomplete\" + ektasis, \"extension\".\n",
      "== signs and symptoms ==\n",
      "\n",
      "== signs and symptoms ==\n",
      "may have no signs and symptoms or they may include:\n",
      "cough, but not prominent;\n",
      "chest pain (not common);\n",
      "breathing difficulty (fast and shallow);\n",
      "low oxygen saturation;\n",
      "pleural effusion (transudate type);\n",
      "cyanosis (late sign);\n",
      "increased heart rate.\n",
      "it is a common misconception and pure speculation that atelectasis causes fever. a study of 100 post-op patients followed with serial chest x-rays and temperature measurements showed that the incidence of fever decreased as the incidence of atelectasis increased. a recent review article summarizing the available published evidence on the association between atelectasis and post-op fever concluded that there is no clinical evidence supporting this speculation.\n",
      "== causes ==\n",
      "the most common cause is post-surgical atelectasis, characterized by splinting, i.e. restricted breathing after abdominal surgery. atelectasis develops in 75-90% of people undergoing general anesthesia for a surgical procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "another common cause is pulmonary tuberculosis. smokers and the elderly are also at an increased risk. outside of this context, atelectasis implies some blockage of a bronchiole or bronchus, which can be within the airway (foreign body, mucus plug), from the wall (tumor, usually squamous cell carcinoma) or compressing from the outside (tumor, lymph node, tubercle). another cause is poor surfactant spreading during inspiration, causing the surface tension to be at its highest which tends to collapse smaller alveoli. atelectasis may also occur during suction, as along with sputum, air is withdrawn from the lungs. there are several types of atelectasis according to their underlying mechanisms or the distribution of alveolar collapse; resorption, compression, microatelectasis and contraction atelectasis. relaxation atelectasis (also called passive atelectasis) is when a pleural effusion or a pneumothorax disrupts the contact between the parietal and visceral pleurae.\n",
      "risk factors associated with increased likelihood of the development of atelectasis include: type of surgery (thoracic, cardiopulmonary surgeries), use of muscle relaxation, obesity, high oxygen, the lower lung segments.\n",
      "\n",
      "factors also associated with the development of atelectasis include: age, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and type of anesthetic.\n",
      "in the early 1950s, in uk aviation medicine, the condition acceleration atelectasis was given the name \"hunter lung\" due to its prevalence in pilots of the transonic fighter jet, the hawker hunter, which used a 100% oxygen supply.\n",
      "== diagnosis ==\n",
      "clinically significant atelectasis is generally visible on chest x-ray; findings can include lung opacification and/or loss of lung volume. post-surgical atelectasis will be bibasal in pattern. chest ct or bronchoscopy may be necessary if the cause of \n",
