# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

## Expected Output
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Age"": 69, ""Heartrate"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (%)"": 99.0}


According to the following report, what can be the value of features provided in the json object? The json object provides the requested feature and their data types. Try to speculate the value instead of saying you don't know or not mentioned. Please return the values in json format as the json object used for indicating data types. And, don't forget the request of specific JSON format in the system prompt, so the returned json object should be a json string in the **description** in the **points**.
And, don't generated repetitive results.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Json Object 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate"": ""numerical"", ""Age"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (%)"": ""numerical""}

## Expected Output
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Age"": 69, ""Heartrate"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (%)"": 99.0}


According to the following report, what can be the value of features provided in the json object? The json object provides the requested feature and their data types. Try to speculate the value instead of saying you don't know or not mentioned. Please return the values in json format as the json object used for indicating data types. And, don't forget the request of specific JSON format in the system prompt, so the returned json object should be a json string in the **description** in the **points**.
And, don't generated repetitive results.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Json Object 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate"": ""numerical"", ""Age"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (%)"": ""numerical""}

## Expected Output
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Age"": 69, ""Heartrate"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (%)"": 99.0}


According to the following report, what can be the value of features provided in the json object? The json object provides the requested feature and their data types. Try to speculate the value instead of saying you don't know or not mentioned. Please return the values in json format as the json object used for indicating data types. And, don't forget the request of specific JSON format in the system prompt, so the returned json object should be a json string in the **description** in the **points**.
And, don't generated repetitive results.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Json Object 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate"": ""numerical"", ""Age"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (%)"": ""numerical""}

## Expected Output
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Age"": 69, ""Heartrate"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (%)"": 99.0}


According to the following report, what can be the value of features provided in the json object? The json object provides the requested feature and their data types. Try to speculate the value instead of saying you don't know or not mentioned. Please return the values in json format as the json object used for indicating data types. And, don't forget the request of specific JSON format in the system prompt, so the returned json object should be a json string in the **description** in the **points**.
And, don't generated repetitive results.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

According to the following report, what can be the value of features provided in the json object? The json object provides the requested feature and their data types. Try to speculate the value instead of saying you don't know or not mentioned. Please return the values in json format as the json object used for indicating data types. And, don't forget the request of specific JSON format in the system prompt, so the returned json object should be a json string in the **description** in the **points**.
And, don't generated repetitive results.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Json Object

## Expected Output
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Age"": 69, ""Heartrate"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (%)"": 99.0}


According to the following report, what can be the value of features provided in the json object? The json object provides the requested feature and their data types. Try to speculate the value instead of saying you don't know or not mentioned. Please return the values in json format as the json object used for indicating data types. And, don't forget the request of specific JSON format in the system prompt, so the returned json object should be a json string in the **description** in the **points**.
And, don't generated repetitive results.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Json Object 
{""Chest pain"": ""boolean"", ""Weight loss"": ""boolean"", ""History of COPD"": ""boolean"", ""Heartrate"": ""numerical"", ""Age"": ""numerical"", ""Oxygen levels (%)"": ""numerical""}

## Expected Output
{""Chest pain"": true, ""Weight loss"": false, ""History of COPD"": true, ""Age"": 69, ""Heartrate"": 90, ""Oxygen levels (%)"": 99.0}


According to the following report, what can be the value of features provided in the json object? The json object provides the requested feature and their data types. Try to speculate the value instead of saying you don't know or not mentioned. Please return the values in json format as the json object used for indicating data types. And, don't forget the request of specific JSON format in the system prompt, so the returned json object should be a json string in the **description** in the **points**.
And, don't generated repetitive results.

**Summary of Lesions: Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette, Pulmonary Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Abnormality**

**Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, chest pain, palpitations, and coughing up blood
*   Causes: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Clinical signs: pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, increased cardiothoracic ratio, anterior mediastinal mass, and prominent epicardial fat pad
*   Laboratory data: pericardial fluid analysis, radiographic images, echocardiographic images, and biopsy results
*   Personal relevant history: history of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly, smoking history, and family history of heart disease

**Pulmonary Consolidation:**

*   Symptoms: breath sounds and crackles, chest pain, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, and coughing up mucus or blood
*   Causes: blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Clinical signs: breath sounds and crackles, blood from the bronchial tree and hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema, pus, and pulmonary infiltrate
*   Laboratory data: elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and family history of respiratory conditions

**Atelectasis:**

*   Symptoms: shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, lung cancer, and surfactant deficiency
*   Clinical signs: lung collapse, increased cardiothoracic ratio, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax
*   Laboratory data: chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, age, previous surgical history, and respiratory conditions

**Pleural Abnormality:**

*   Symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and weight loss
*   Causes: pleural effusion, pneumoperitoneum, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and symptomatic pneumothorax
*   Clinical signs: pleural effusion, atelectasis, tension pneumothorax, and pneumoperitoneum
*   Laboratory data: pleural fluid analysis, blood tests, chest radiography, CT scans, and pulmonary function tests
*   Personal relevant history: smoking history, lung cancer or other malignancies, medical history, family history, and occupational and environmental history

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report

COMPARISON:  Recent chest radiograph from  and PA and lateral chestradiographs from .
AP SEMIERECT AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Evaluation is limited due tosignificant patient rotation to the right.  Median sternotomy wires appearintact.  Moderately severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette appearsgrossly unchanged.  Evaluation of the mediastinum is limited due to thesignificant patient rotation.  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Theappearance is similar to recent portable radiograph from .  Blunting ofthe bilateral costophrenic angles is chronic and are compatible withpersistent small pleural effusions.  No confluent consolidation orpneumothorax is present.  Evidence of prior vertebroplasty in the mid thoracicspine is unchanged from prior.

HISTORY:  A yearold female with the recent aortic valve replacement nowpresenting with increasing cough.
COMPARISON:  Recent chest radiograph from  and PA and lateral chestradiographs from .
AP SEMIERECT AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Evaluation is limited due tosignificant patient rotation to the right.  Median sternotomy wires appearintact.  Moderately severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette appearsgrossly unchanged.  Evaluation of the mediastinum is limited due to thesignificant patient rotation.  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Theappearance is similar to recent portable radiograph from .  Blunting ofthe bilateral costophrenic angles is chronic and are compatible withpersistent small pleural effusions.  No confluent consolidation orpneumothorax is present.  Evidence of prior vertebroplasty in the mid thoracicspine is unchanged from prior.
IMPRESSION:1.  Limited examination due to poor patient positioning.2.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is similar to recent prior examinationwith small bilateral pleural effusions.3.  Stable moderately severe cardiomegaly.4.  No confluent consolidation or pneumothorax.

# Task you're going to perform

You will be given a report regarding a patient, and a json object with for you to sepculate the values of each attribute. 
You will return the speculated values according to the data type specified in the give JSON Object. You need to speculate the value, and null value is not acceptable.
Keep your responses brief, and they can't be more than 5000 tokens.
Don't be unit (e.g., cm, L) in the value. Only numerical characters for numerical data types, and only true or false for boolean data types.

Following is an example for you:

## Report
INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.
TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.
FINDINGS: 
A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheterterminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior venacava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within thelow SVC.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remainsmildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome forpneumonia.
High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the leftabdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcificationsleft greater than right.
DIAGNOSED LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
AGE: 69.
GENDER: Female.

## Report
EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LAT
INDICATION:  History: F being treated for pneumonia. Eval for effusion PNA
TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
COMPARISON:  None
FINDINGS: 
Prominence of the cardiac contour is likely due to prominent mediastinal fatobscuring the left lung base on the PA view. Heart size is top normal. Noevidence of pleural effusion on the lateral view. Lungs are mildlyhyperexpanded.
